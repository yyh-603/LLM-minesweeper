REASON: The cell at (2, 4) has 2 neighboring mines, and we know that the cell at (3, 2) is a mine. Therefore, we can deduce that the cell at (2, 3) is also a mine as it has 1 neighboring mine.
ACTION: flag 2 3

CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. The cell at (2, 4) has 2 neighboring mines, and we know that the cell at (3, 2) is a mine. Therefore, flagging the cell at (2, 3) as a mine is a valid deduction.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 2 3

CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is valid. The cell at (2, 4) does indeed have 2 neighboring mines, and knowing that the cell at (3, 2) is a mine allows us to deduce that the cell at (2, 3) is a mine as well.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 2 3
