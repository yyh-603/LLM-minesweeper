REASON: The cell at (4, 2) has 2 neighboring mines. We know that the cells at (3, 1) and (4, 1) are both safe, as all their neighboring mines have been flagged, and they have 1 neighboring mine each. Thus, we can safely open the cell at (3, 2).
ACTION: open 3 2
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (4, 1) actually has 2 neighboring mines, not 1. Therefore, we should not assume it is safe. The existing reason for choosing to open (3, 2) is invalid.

CORRECTION ACTION: flag 4 1
