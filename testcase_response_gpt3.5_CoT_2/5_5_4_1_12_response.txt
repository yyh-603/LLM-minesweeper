REASON: The cell at (4, 1) has 1 neighboring mine, and we know that the cell at (3, 2) is a mine. Therefore, the cell at (4, 0) is a mine as well.
ACTION: flag 4 0
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is valid.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 4 0
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (4, 1) already has 2 neighboring mines revealed and flagged. There is only 1 neighboring cell that is not opened, so we cannot infer that the cell at (4, 0) is a mine. We need more information to flag the cell at (4, 0).

CORRECTION ACTION: open 4 2
