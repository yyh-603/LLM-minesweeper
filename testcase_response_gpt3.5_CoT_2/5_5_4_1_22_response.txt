REASON: The cell at (4, 1) has 1 neighboring mine and the cell at (3, 2) has 2 neighboring mines. The cell at (4, 2) must be safe to open since there are no neighboring mines from the cell at (4, 1) and (3, 2).
ACTION: open 4 2
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (4, 1) having 1 neighboring mine and the cell at (3, 2) having 2 neighboring mines do not provide enough information to determine the safety of the cell at (4, 2) as it could still potentially have a mine. 

Consider another cell, the cell at (4, 2) has 1 neighboring mine and the cell at (3, 3) has 2 neighboring mines. We can deduce that the cell at (4, 3) is safe to open because it doesn't have any neighboring mines from (4,2) and (3,3).

CORRECTION ACTION: open 4 3
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is not accurate as it doesn't provide enough information to deduce the safety of the cell at (4, 2).
CORRECTION ACTION: open 4 3
