REASON: The cell at (4, 3) has 1 neighboring mine, and we know that the cell at (6, 1) is a mine. Therefore, we can safely open the cell at (6, 2).
ACTION: open 6 2
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (4, 3) having 1 neighboring mine does not provide information about the cell at (6, 1) being a mine. Hence, the conclusion to open (6, 2) might be premature.

Consider cell (1, 1) which has 1 neighboring mine, and since the cell (1, 0) is not opened yet, we can deduct that cell (1, 2) is safe to open as it does not have a mine. Let's open cell (1, 2) instead.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 1 2

CORRECTION REASON: The conclusion drawn for the cell at (4, 3) not providing information about the neighbor (6, 1) is accurate. However, the deduction about opening cell (6, 2) being premature is incorrect.
