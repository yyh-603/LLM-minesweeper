REASON: The cell at (2, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (3, 2) has 3 neighboring mines. Since we know that the cell at (3, 1) is a mine, the cell at (3, 3) must be safe to open.
ACTION: open 3 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing action is incorrect. The cell at (2, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (3, 2) has 3 neighboring mines. Knowing that the cell at (3, 1) is a mine does not provide enough information about the safety of the cell at (3, 3).
CORRECTION ACTION: The cell at (2, 1) has 1 neighboring mine, and the neighboring cells are already opened. Hence, it is safe to open the cell at (3, 3).
CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 3
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. The cell at (2, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (3, 2) has 3 neighboring mines. Knowing that the cell at (3, 1) is a mine does not provide enough information about the safety of the cell at (3, 3).
CORRECTION ACTION: The cell at (1, 4) has 1 neighboring mine, and all neighboring cells are opened. Hence, it is safe to open the cell at (2, 4).
ACTION: open 2 4
