REASON: The cell at (4, 1) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (3, 2) already has 3 neighboring mines. By deduction, we can infer that the cell at (4, 2) is safe to open, as it cannot have a mine.
ACTION: open 4 2
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The deduction is incorrect. The cell at (3, 2) is not directly related to the safety of the cell at (4, 2) because there are still unopened cells adjacent to (4, 2) that could potentially contain mines.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 4 2
