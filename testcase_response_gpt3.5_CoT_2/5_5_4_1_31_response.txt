REASON: The cell at (2, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (3, 3) has 1 neighboring mine. Therefore, the cell at (3, 2) must be safe to open. 

ACTION: open 3 2
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (3, 3) having 1 neighboring mine does not provide enough information to determine the safety of the cell at (3, 2). Considering the cell at (4, 2) having 1 neighboring mine, we can deduce that the cell at (4, 1) is safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 4 1

CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (4, 2) having 1 neighboring mine does not provide enough information to determine the safety of the cell at (4, 1). However, the cell at (3, 3) having 1 neighboring mine allows us to deduce that the cell at (3, 2) is safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 2
