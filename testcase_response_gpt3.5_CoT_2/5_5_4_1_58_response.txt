REASON: The cell at (1, 1) has 1 neighboring mine, and there is only 1 neighboring cell that is not opened, so the cell at (0, 0) must be a mine.  
ACTION: flag 0 0

CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. The cell at (1, 1) has 1 neighboring mine, and there is only 1 neighboring cell that is not opened, so the cell at (0, 0) must be a mine.  
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 0 0

CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. The cell at (1, 1) actually has 1 neighboring mine, but we cannot deduce the content of the cell at (0, 0) based on this information alone. Let's reevaluate.
Consider the cell at (0, 2) which has 1 neighboring mine and only 1 neighboring cell that is not opened. We can deduce that the cell at (1, 3) must be a mine, so we should flag it instead.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 1 3
