REASON: Because the cell at (0, 1) has 1 neighboring mine, and we know that the cell at (1, 1) and (1, 3) are not mines based on the given information, we can safely open the cell at (0, 3).
ACTION: open 0 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is valid. Based on the information provided, the cell at (0, 1) having 1 neighboring mine and the cells at (1, 1) and (1, 3) not being mines, it is safe to open the cell at (0, 3).
CORRECTION ACTION: open 0 3
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: While the reasoning is correct about the cell at (0, 1) having 1 neighboring mine and the cells at (1, 1) and (1, 3) not being mines, we cannot conclusively determine the safety of the cell at (0, 3) solely based on this information.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 0 3
