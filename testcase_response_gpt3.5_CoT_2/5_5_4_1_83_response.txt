------- 0th response -------
REASON: The cell at (4, 0) has no neighboring mines, and we already know that the cell at (3, 0) has 1 neighboring mine. Therefore, we can safely open the cell at (3, 1).
ACTION: open 3 1
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. The cell at (4, 0) has no neighboring mines, and we know that the cell at (3, 0) has 1 neighboring mine. Therefore, we can safely open the cell at (3, 1).
CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 1
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. The cell at (4, 0) does not necessarily mean the cell at (3, 0) has 1 neighboring mine. We need to reevaluate the neighboring cells of the cell at (3, 1) to make a safe move.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 2 1
