REASON: The cell at (4, 2) has 2 neighboring mines. We already know that the cell at (3, 3) is a mine, so we can deduce that the cells at (3, 2) and (4, 1) are also mines. Therefore, the cell at (4, 4) is safe to open.
ACTION: open 4 4

CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. The cell at (4, 2) has 2 neighboring mines, and based on the known mines at (3, 3), we can deduce that the cells at (3, 2) and (4, 1) are also mines. Therefore, it is safe to open the cell at (4, 4).
CORRECTION ACTION: open 4 4
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is not correct. Although the cell at (4, 2) has 2 neighboring mines, we do not have any information to deduce the state of cells (3, 2) and (4, 1). Hence, we cannot guarantee that it is safe to open the cell at (4, 4) based on the current information.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 4 4
