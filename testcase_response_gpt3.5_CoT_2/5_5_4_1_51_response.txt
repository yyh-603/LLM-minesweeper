REASON: The cell at (3, 4) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (4, 3) has 2 neighboring mines. Since the mine count is satisfied for these cells, we can conclude that the cell at (4, 4) is safe to open.
ACTION: open 4 4
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. The cell at (3, 4) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (4, 3) has 2 neighboring mines, which means the cell at (4, 4) is safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 4 4
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. The cell at (3, 4) having 1 neighboring mine does not provide enough information to determine if cell (4, 4) is safe to open. We need to gather more information about the neighboring cells.
Consider the cell at (2, 4) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (3, 3) has 2 neighboring mines. To further analyze, we see the cell at (2, 3) has 1 neighboring mine as well. Since the neighboring mines are accounted for, we can now safely open the cell at (2, 1). 
CORRECTION ACTION: open 2 1
