REASON: Because the cell at (2, 4) has 2 neighboring mines and all neighboring mines are already flagged, we can safely open the cell at (3, 4) as it has 0 neighboring mines.
ACTION: open 3 4

The existing action is accurate.

CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (2, 4) has 2 neighboring mines, and all neighboring mines are already flagged, so it is safe to open the cell at (3, 4) as it has 0 neighboring mines.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 4
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (2, 4) has 2 neighboring mines, and all neighboring mines are already flagged, so it is safe to open the cell at (3, 4) as it has 0 neighboring mines. However, the cell at (2, 2) has only one neighboring mine flagged, and the cell at (3, 3) has two neighboring mines flagged. So, it is more logical to flag the cell at (2, 2) to be safe. 
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 2 2
