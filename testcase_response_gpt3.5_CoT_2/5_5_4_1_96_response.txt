------- 0th response -------
REASON: The cell at (0, 0) already has one neighboring mine, and all neighboring cells are already opened, so we can safely open the cell at (0, 1).
ACTION: open 0 1
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 0 1
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (0, 1) has 1 neighboring mine, and we know that the cell at (1, 1) is not a mine, so we can deduce that the cell at (1, 0) is a mine. Therefore, it is safer to flag the cell at (1, 0) instead of opening (0, 1).
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 1 0
