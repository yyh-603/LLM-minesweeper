REASON: The cell at (1, 2) has 2 neighboring mines, and the cell at (2, 2) has 1 neighboring mine. Since the neighboring cell at (2, 1) is already opened and has no mine, we can deduce that the cell at (1, 3) is a mine.
ACTION: flag 1 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. The cell at (1, 2) having 2 neighboring mines and the cell at (2, 2) having 1 neighboring mine do not provide enough information to deduce that the cell at (1, 3) is a mine.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 0 2
------- 2th response -------
The existing reason is incorrect. The information provided about the cells at (1, 2) and (2, 2) is not sufficient to deduce that the cell at (1, 3) is a mine.  
CORRECTION ACTION: open 0 0
