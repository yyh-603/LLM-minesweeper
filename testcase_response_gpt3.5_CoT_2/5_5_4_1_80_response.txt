------- 0th response -------
REASON: Because the cell at (2, 1) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (3, 0) has 2 neighboring mines, we can deduce that the cell at (2, 3) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag it for safety. 
ACTION: flag 2 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect because we cannot deduce the cell at (2, 3) is a mine based on the information provided.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 1
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. We cannot deduce the cell at (2, 3) is a mine based on the information provided. Instead, we see that the cell at (3, 2) has 2 neighboring mines, so we can deduce that the cell at (4, 1) is a mine.

CORRECTION ACTION: flag 4 1
