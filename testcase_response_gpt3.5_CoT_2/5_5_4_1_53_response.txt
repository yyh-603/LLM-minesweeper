------- 0th response -------
REASON: The cell at (1, 1) has 2 neighboring mines, and the cell at (1, 2) is only adjacent to one covered cell. Therefore, the cell at (2, 2) is a mine.
ACTION: flag 2 2
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (1, 1) having 2 neighboring mines does not provide enough information to flag a mine at cell (2, 2). The neighboring covered cell at (2, 3) could also be a mine.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 2 3
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The reason provided is valid. The cell at (1, 1) having 2 neighboring mines indeed does not provide enough information to flag a mine at cell (2, 2).
CORRECTION ACTION: No correction needed. The action to flag cell (2, 3) is appropriate based on the given information.
