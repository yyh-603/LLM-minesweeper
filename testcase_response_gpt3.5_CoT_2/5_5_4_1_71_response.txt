CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (3, 3) has 2 neighboring mines, and we know that the cell at (2, 2) is a mine, but we cannot ensure that the remaining unopened cell at (3, 2) is safe to open based on this information alone. We need more information to make a safe decision.

CORRECTION ACTION: flag 3 2
