REASON: There are two cells with number 1 that have all neighboring cells opened, which means they already have 1 mine adjacent to them. Therefore, the cells adjacent to them that haven't been opened yet cannot have mines. We can safely open those cells to progress without the risk of hitting a mine.
ACTION: open 2 2
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason provided is accurate. The cells adjacent to cells with number 1 that have all neighboring cells opened do not contain mines.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 0 0
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is not accurate for the current game state. The cell at (0, 1) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (1, 0) has 1 neighboring mine, so we cannot safely conclude that the cell at (0, 0) is safe to open.  
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 0 0
