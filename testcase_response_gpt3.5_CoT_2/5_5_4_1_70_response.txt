REASON: Because the cell at (2, 2) has 2 neighboring mines, and the cell at (3, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, we can deduce that the cell at (3, 1) is safe to open as it cannot have a mine based on the neighboring counts.
ACTION: open 3 1
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. The cell at (2, 2) having 2 neighboring mines and the cell at (3, 2) having 1 neighboring mine does not provide enough information to deduce that the cell at (3, 1) is safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 2 1
