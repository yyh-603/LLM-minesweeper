REASON: The cell at (1, 3) has 2 neighboring mines, and all of its neighboring cells are opened. Thus, we can determine that the cell at (0, 4) is a mine since it has 2 neighboring mines.
ACTION: flag 0 4
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The reason provided is incorrect. The cell at (1, 3) cannot determine the status of cell (0, 4) directly. We need to reevaluate the board state.
Consider cell (1, 0), as it has 2 neighboring mines and all neighboring cells are opened, we can determine that the cell at (0, 0) is safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 0 0
