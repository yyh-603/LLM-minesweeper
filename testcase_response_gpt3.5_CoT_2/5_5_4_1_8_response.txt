REASON: The cell at (4, 4) has 2 neighboring mines, and the neighboring cells already have 3 mines marked. Therefore, the remaining unmarked neighbor at (3, 3) must be a mine. Hence, we should flag the cell at (3, 3).

ACTION: flag 3 3

CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is valid. The cell at (4, 4) indeed has 2 neighboring mines. The neighboring cells already have 3 mines marked. Therefore, the remaining unmarked neighbor at (3, 3) must be a mine.

CORRECTION ACTION: flag 3 3

CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is not correct. The cell at (4, 4) does have 2 neighboring mines, but knowing that the neighboring cells have 3 mines marked does not necessarily mean the remaining unmarked neighbor at (3, 3) must be a mine. We need to reevaluate the situation.

Consider another cell, the cell at (2, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and we know that the cell at (4, 2) is a mine. Therefore, we can open the cell at (3, 1) safely.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 1
