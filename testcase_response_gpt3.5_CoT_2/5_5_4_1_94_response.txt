REASON: In the current board state, the cell at (0,2) has 1 neighboring mine, and the neighboring cell at (1,3) has not been opened yet. Since there must be a mine neighboring the cell at (0,2), I can safely flag the cell at (1,3) as a mine.

Given the current game state and the existing reason, the action to flag the cell at (1, 3) seems accurate as it follows the logic of flagging a cell that is likely to contain a mine.
