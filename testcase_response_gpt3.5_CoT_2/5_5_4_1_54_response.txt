------- 0th response -------
REASON: The cell at (1, 1) already has 2 neighboring mines, and the cell at (2, 2) has 2 neighboring mines. Considering the constraints, it's safe to open the cell at (1, 3).
ACTION: open 1 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (1, 1) having 2 neighboring mines does not directly imply that the cell at (2, 2) is a mine. The information is not sufficient to safely open the cell at (1, 3).
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 1 3
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The information provided about the cell at (1, 1) having 2 neighboring mines does not directly imply that the cell at (2, 2) is a mine. It is not safe to assume the cell at (1, 3) is clear based on the current information.

CORRECTION ACTION: flag 1 3
