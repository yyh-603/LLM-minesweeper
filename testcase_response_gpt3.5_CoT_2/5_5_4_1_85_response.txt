REASON: Because the cell at (3, 3) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (4, 3) has 1 neighboring mine, we can deduce that the cell at (4, 4) is safe to open since there is only 1 mine around it.
ACTION: open 4 4
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The deduction made about the cell at (4, 4) being safe to open based on the neighboring mines at (3, 3) and (4, 3) is incorrect. There might be additional mines in the unopened cells nearby which could make the cell at (4, 4) unsafe to open.

CORRECTION ACTION: flag 4 4

CORRECTION REASON: Flagging the cell at (4, 4) will ensure that if there is a mine in its neighboring cells, the game can proceed safely.
