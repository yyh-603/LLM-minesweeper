REASON: The cell at (3, 3) has 2 neighboring mines, and the cell at (4, 2) is a mine. Therefore, the mines around the cell at (4, 3) have already been accounted for, and it is safe to open.
ACTION: open 4 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. The cell at (3, 4) has 2 neighboring mines, and the cell at (4, 2) is a mine. Therefore, we can deduce that the cell at (4, 3) is also a mine. It is not safe to open that cell.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 4 3
