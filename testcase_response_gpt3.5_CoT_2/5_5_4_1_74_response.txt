REASON: Since the cell at (2, 4) has 1 neighboring mine, and we know that the neighboring cell at (3, 3) is a mine, it is safe to open the cell at (3, 4) to progress in clearing the board.
ACTION: open 3 4
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. The cell at (2, 4) indeed has 1 neighboring mine, and the neighboring cell at (3, 3) is a mine, indicating that it is safe to open the cell at (3, 4).
CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 4
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. There is no information about the neighboring cell at (3, 3) being a mine, so we cannot deduce that the cell at (2, 4) is safe to open based on the given information.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 2 4
