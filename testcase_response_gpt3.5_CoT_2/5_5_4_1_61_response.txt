REASON: Looking at the cell at (1, 2) which has 1 neighboring mine, and knowing that the cell at (2, 3) is a mine, we can deduce that the cell at (1, 3) is also a mine. Thus, it is safe to open the cell at (3, 4).
ACTION: open 3 4

CORRECTION REASON: There is a mistake in the reasoning. The cell at (1, 2) has only 1 neighboring mine, and knowing that the cell at (2, 3) is a mine, we can deduce that the cell at (1, 3) is safe to open, not a mine. Therefore, it is safe to open the cell at (3, 4).
CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 4
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (1, 2) actually has 1 neighboring mine, and knowing that the cell at (2, 3) is a mine, we can deduce that the cell at (1, 3) is safe to open, not a mine. Therefore, the correct cell to open is at (1, 3), not (3, 4).
CORRECTION ACTION: open 1 3
