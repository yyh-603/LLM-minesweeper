REASON: The cell at (2, 2) indicates that there are 2 neighboring mines. Given that the cell at (1, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and we already know the cells (1, 3) and (2, 3) are safe, we can determine that the remaining neighbors of (2, 2) must be mines. Thus, we can safely flag the cells at (1, 1) and (1, 0).
