REASON: The cell at (0, 1) has 2 neighboring mines, and all its neighboring cells are opened. Therefore, we can safely open the cell at (0, 2) as it is guaranteed to be safe.
ACTION: open 0 2
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. The cell at (0, 1) has 2 neighboring mines and all its neighboring cells are opened, so we can safely open the cell at (0, 2).
CORRECTION ACTION: open 0 2
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. The cell at (0, 1) does have 2 neighboring mines, but there are unopened neighboring cells (0, 0 and 1, 0), so we cannot determine if cell (0, 2) is safe to open based solely on the given information.

CORRECTION ACTION: flag 0 2
