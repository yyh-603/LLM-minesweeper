------- 0th response -------
REASON: The cell at (2, 3) has 1 neighboring mine, and we know that the cell at (1, 2) is a mine. Therefore, we can safely open the cell at (0, 3) as it does not contain a mine.
ACTION: open 0 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. The cell at (1, 2) having 1 neighboring mine does not provide information about the neighboring cells in this case.

Consider the cell at (3, 1) which has 2 neighboring mines. We know that the cell at (4, 0) is a mine. Therefore, we can safely flag the cell at (4, 1).

CORRECTION ACTION: flag 4 1
