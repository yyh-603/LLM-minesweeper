REASON: The cell at (2, 4) has 2 neighboring mines, and we know that there is a mine at (2, 2). Since there are only 2 mines in the 5 neighboring cells, the cell at (2, 0) must be safe to open.
ACTION: open 2 0
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is not correct because we have more information available. The cell at (2, 3) has 2 neighboring mines, and we already know the mines at (2, 2) and (2, 4). Therefore, the cell at (2, 1) must be safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 2 1
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. The cell at (2, 1) indeed has 2 neighboring mines, and we already know the mines at (2, 3) and (1, 3). Therefore, the cell at (2, 2) must be safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 2 2
