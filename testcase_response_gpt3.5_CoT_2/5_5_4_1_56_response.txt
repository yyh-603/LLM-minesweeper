REASON: The cell at (0, 3) has 1 neighboring mine and the cell at (1, 4) has 1 neighboring mine. Since the cell at (1, 3) can only have 1 neighboring mine based on adjacent cells, we can flag the cell at (1, 3) as a mine.
ACTION: flag 1 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. The cell at (0, 3) has 1 neighboring mine and the cell at (1, 4) has 1 neighboring mine. Given that the cell at (1, 3) can only have 1 neighboring mine based on adjacent cells, flagging the cell at (1, 3) as a mine is a valid and safe move.

CORRECTION ACTION: flag 1 3
