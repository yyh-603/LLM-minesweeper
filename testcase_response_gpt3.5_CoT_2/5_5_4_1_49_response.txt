REASON: The cell at (1, 0) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (2, 0) has 0 neighboring mines, so the cell at (0, 1) must be safe to open.  
ACTION: open 0 1
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (1, 0) has 1 neighboring mine, but we cannot infer the safety of the cell at (0, 1) based on this information alone.
Consider another cell, the cell at (2, 1) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (3, 1) has 0 neighboring mines, so the cell at (1, 2) must be safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 1 2
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is valid. The cell at (1, 0) having 1 neighboring mine does not provide enough information to determine the safety of the cell at (0, 1).
CORRECTION ACTION: There is no need to change the action. The action to open the cell at (1, 2) is valid.
