REASON: The cell at (2, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and we know that the cell at (3, 2) is a mine. Therefore, the cell at (3, 3) must be safe to open.  
ACTION: open 3 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (2, 2) indeed has 1 neighboring mine, but there is not enough information to determine if the cell at (3, 3) is safe to open. Instead, we can deduce that the cell at (3, 4) is safe to open since the cell at (2, 4) has 2 neighboring mines.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 4
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. There is not enough information to determine if the cell at (3, 3) is safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 4
