REASON: The cell at (2, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (3, 3) is an already opened cell with no neighboring mines. Therefore, the cell at (2, 3) is safe to open as it cannot contain a mine.
ACTION: open 2 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (2, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, but we cannot infer the safety of the cell at (2, 3) based on the current information.
Consider another cell, the cell at (1, 3) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (2, 3) is already opened with no neighboring mines. Therefore, the cell at (1, 4) is safe to open as it cannot contain a mine.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 1 4
