REASON: Because the cell at (2, 4) has 1 neighboring mine and the cell at (3, 3) has 1 neighboring mine, we can deduce that the cell at (3, 4) is safe to open as it cannot have a mine. 
ACTION: open 3 4

CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. The cell at (2, 4) having 1 neighboring mine and the cell at (3, 3) having 1 neighboring mine does not necessarily guarantee that the cell at (3, 4) is safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 3 4
