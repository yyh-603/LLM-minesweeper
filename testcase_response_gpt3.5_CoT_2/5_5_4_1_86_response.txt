REASON: The cell at (2, 2) has 3 neighboring mines, and we already know the cells (1, 3), (0, 3) and (0, 4) are safe. Therefore, we can open the cell at (1, 2) safely.
ACTION: open 1 2
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (2, 2) does have 3 neighboring mines, but we cannot determine the safety of the cells (1, 3), (0, 3), and (0, 4) based on the known information.
Consider another cell, the cell at (2, 1) has 2 neighboring mines, and the cells (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 4) are safe. Hence, we can open the cell at (1, 1) safely.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 1 1
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. Based on the known information, we can safely open the cell at (1, 1). 
CORRECTION ACTION: open 1 1
