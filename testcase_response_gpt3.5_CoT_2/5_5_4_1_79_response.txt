REASON: The cell at (2, 3) has 2 neighboring mines, and we know that the cell at (1, 2) is a mine. Therefore, we can open the cell at (1, 3) safely.
ACTION: open 1 3
------- 1th response -------
The existing action is incorrect.

CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (2, 3) indeed has 2 neighboring mines, and we know that the cell at (1, 2) is a mine. However, since the cell at (1, 3) only has 1 neighboring mine and not 2 as you assumed, we cannot open it safely.

CORRECTION ACTION: flag 1 3
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (1, 3) only has 1 neighboring mine, not 2. Therefore, it is not safe to open the cell at (2, 3) assuming there are 2 mines around it.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 2 3
