REASON: The cell at (2, 2) has 2 neighboring mines, and the cell at (3, 2) has 1 neighboring mine. Given this information, the remaining covered cell adjacent to the cell at (2, 2) must be safe to open.
ACTION: open 3 1
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. There is only one remaining covered cell adjacent to the cell at (2, 2), which must be safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 1
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is not entirely accurate. While it is correct that there is one remaining covered cell adjacent to the cell at (2, 2), it does not necessarily mean it is safe to open because there could be a mine underneath. Considering the cell at (2, 3) with 2 neighboring mines, it is safer to flag it before opening the cell at (3, 1).
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 2 3
