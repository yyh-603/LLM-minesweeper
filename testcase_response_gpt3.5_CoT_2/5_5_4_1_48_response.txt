REASON: The cell at (2, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (1, 1) has already been opened and has 2 neighboring mines. Therefore, the cell at (2, 1) is safe to open.

ACTION: open 2 1
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (1, 1) having 2 neighboring mines does not provide direct information about the safety of the cell at (2, 1). We need to consider the states of neighboring cells of (2, 1).
Consider the cell at (2, 1), as it has 0 neighboring mines and only 1 neighboring cell is not opened, we can infer that the cell at (2, 0) is a mine. Therefore, it is safe to open the cell at (2, 1).

CORRECTION ACTION: open 2 1
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. The cell at (1, 1) having 2 neighboring mines does not provide direct information about the safety of the cell at (2, 1). We need to consider the states of neighboring cells of (2, 1).
CORRECTION ACTION: open 2 1
