REASON: Since the cell at (2, 3) has 3 neighboring mines, and we know that the cells at (1, 3) and (2, 4) are mines, we can deduce that the cell at (1, 4) must be safe to open.
ACTION: open 1 4

CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. The cell at (2, 3) has 3 neighboring mines, and we know that the cells at (1, 3) and (2, 4) are mines, so the cell at (1, 4) is safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 1 4

CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is partially correct. The cell at (2, 3) does have 3 neighboring mines, but we cannot be certain that the cells at (1, 3) and (2, 4) are mines based on the given information. Instead, we should focus on the cell at (1, 2) which has 1 neighboring mine and can help us determine the neighboring cells. 
CORRECTION ACTION: open 1 2
