REASON: The cell at (3, 2) has 2 neighboring mines and the cell at (3, 3) has 2 neighboring mines. Since all neighboring cells of the cell at (3, 1) have been opened, we can deduce that the cell at (3, 1) is safe to open.
ACTION: open 3 1
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The current action is incorrect because the cell at (3, 3) has 2 neighboring mines and the cell at (3, 2) has 1 neighboring mine. We don't have enough information to safely open the cell at (3, 1) yet.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 3 1
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The current action is incorrect because there are 2 neighboring mines around the cell at (3, 3) and 1 neighboring mine around the cell at (3, 2), which means we still don't have enough information to safely open the cell at (3, 1) yet.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 3 1
