REASON: The cell at (2, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (2, 4) has 1 neighboring mine. Since all neighboring mines are already identified, we can infer that the cell at (1, 3) is safe to open.
ACTION: open 1 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. There is one neighboring mine at (2, 2) and one neighboring mine at (2, 4), so the cell at (1, 3) is safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 1 3
