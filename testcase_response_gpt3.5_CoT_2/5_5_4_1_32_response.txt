REASON: Because the cell at (3, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and we know that the cell at (3, 3) and (4, 2) are mines, we can flag the cell at (4, 3) as a mine since the neighboring mine count is 1.
ACTION: flag 4 3

The existing action is incorrect.
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (3, 2) indeed has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (3, 3) and (4, 2) are mines. However, we cannot directly conclude that the cell at (4, 3) is a mine just based on the neighboring mine count being 1. It is safer to open the cell at (3, 1) since it has no neighboring mines and can give us more information.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 1
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. Based on the current state of the board, we cannot directly conclude that the cell at (4, 3) is a mine just because the cell at (3, 2) has 1 neighboring mine. It is safer to open the cell at (3, 1) which has no neighboring mines.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 1
