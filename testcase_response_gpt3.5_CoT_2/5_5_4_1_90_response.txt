REASON: The cell at (0, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and the two neighboring cells at (1, 1) and (1, 2) are both opened and have a total of 2 neighboring mines. So, we can conclude that the cell at (0, 1) is safe to open.
ACTION: open 0 1
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct. The cell at (0, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and the neighboring cells at (1, 1) and (1, 2) are opened with a total of 2 neighboring mines, indicating that the cell at (0, 1) is safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 0 1
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is incorrect. The cell at (0, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, indicating that the cell at (1, 2) is a mine. Therefore, the cell at (0, 1) is not necessarily safe to open.
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 0 1
