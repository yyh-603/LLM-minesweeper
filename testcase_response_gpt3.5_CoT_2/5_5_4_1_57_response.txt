REASON: The cell at (3, 0) has 2 neighboring mines, and we know that the cell at (3, 2) is already flagged as a mine. Therefore, the cell at (2, 1) must be safe to open as it has only 1 neighboring mine.
ACTION: open 2 1
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is correct because the cell at (3, 0) has 2 neighboring mines, and the cell at (3, 2) is already flagged as a mine. So, the cell at (2, 1) must be safe to open as it has only 1 neighboring mine.
CORRECTION ACTION: open 2 1
------- 2th response -------
