REASON: The cell at (2, 3) has 2 neighboring mines already. Since the cell at (3, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, we can deduce that the cell at (3, 3) is safe to open. There are no neighboring mines.
ACTION: open 3 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is valid as the cell at (3, 2) has 1 neighboring mine. However, additionally considering the cell at (2, 3) which has 2 neighboring mines, we can deduce that the cell at (2, 2) is also a mine. So, we should flag the cell at (2, 2) instead of opening the cell at (3, 3).
CORRECTION ACTION: flag 2 2
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is valid, as the cell at (3, 2) has 1 neighboring mine. The cell at (2, 3) having 2 neighboring mines is also noted. However, considering the cell at (2, 4) which has 1 neighboring mine, we can deduce that the cell at (3, 3) is empty and safe to open. So, we should open the cell at (3, 3) instead of flagging the cell at (2, 2).
CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 3
