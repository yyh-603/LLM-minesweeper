Let's analyze the provided board step by step:

```
TABLE:
0 0 0 1 . 
1 1 0 1 . 
. 2 1 1 . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
```

1. The cells with a number indicate how many mines are adjacent to them.
2. Cells labeled as '0' have no adjacent mines, and their neighboring cells can be safely opened. 

Considering these observations:
- The cells (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2) are '0', meaning all their neighboring cells are safe.

From this configuration, we can safely deduce that:
- The entirety of row 1 columns 0 through 2 can be safely opened because they are adjacent to '0'.
- Additionally, cells in row 1 reveal adjacent cells, potentially helping us identify more safe cells.

Thus, let's pick the cell (1, 2) to open next, as its neighbors are already confirmed to be safe:
```
REASON: The cells in row 1, columns 0 through 2 are adjacent to '0s', indicating they have no neighboring mines, hence, opening (1, 2) is safe.
ACTION: open 1 2
```

CORRECTION REASON: The cells in row 1, columns 0 through 2 are indeed adjacent to '0s', but specifically looking at cell (1, 2) alone and its neighboring cells does not guarantee safety. Instead, considering the nearby cells in the safest manner might lead us to open a more logically inferred cell. Instead of cell (1, 2), cell (2, 0) seems much safer since it is immediately next to a '0', making it highly likely to be non-mine.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 2 0
