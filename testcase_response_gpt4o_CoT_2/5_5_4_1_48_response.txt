Let's analyze the current table step by step:

```
. . 1 0 0 
. 2 1 0 0 
. 1 0 0 0 
. 1 1 1 1 
. . . . . 
```

The goal is to find the most logical and safe move.

1. The cell at (0, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, but only one covered neighbor `(1, 1)`.
2. The cell at (1, 1) has 2 neighboring mines, implying there are two mines around it. Possible positions are (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and cells on the second row.
3. The (1, 1) helps us determine that (0, 1) and (1, 0) are more likely to be safe since (0, 2) already touches a mine.

Next, since it's more helpful for immediate inference to flag certain mines:

REASON: The cell at (0, 0) and cell at (1, 0) are more likely to be safe. The cell at (1, 1) covers `2`, which means (0, 1) and (0, 2) definitely have at least one mine, particularly around the second row. The safe bet: opening a cell with lesser chances.

ACTION: open 0 3
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reasoning does not utilize the information on the fully opened cells effectively. Let¡¦s analyze the current situation closely:

1. The cell at (1, 1) is an opened cell showing `2`, meaning there are 2 mines in its neighboring cells.
2. The opened cells around (1, 1) are (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2). These cells show numbers indicating neighboring mines.
3. The cell (0, 2) shows `1`, implying there is exactly one mine in its adjacent cells.
4. The only covered cells around (0, 2) are (0, 1) and (1, 2). So, one of them is definitely a mine.
5. The cell (1, 0) shows `2`, implying there are exactly two mines in its adjacent cells.
6. The only covered cells around (1, 0) are (0, 0) and (1, 1). Based on the cell states and numbers, further analysis may suggest actions.

Furthermore, it's essential to open or flag a cell that provides useful information or increases safety for other cells.

It's evident that opening cells far from the cluster, without such analysis, might not provide strategic information.

**Existing action analysis:**
Opening cell (0, 3) may result in the summary of obtaining non-crucial data, as the action disregards the core logic of opening cells closer to known ones.

**Revised action:**
Focus on the cells around (1, 1), a safer choice would be an immediate neighboring cell that is highly likely to be empty based on surrounding clues.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 1 0

---CORRECTION REASON---
The existing reasoning does not address a specific action or suggest any immediate move. However, the analysis of the cells around (1,1) and (0,2) helps us to understand the clues available. Given the information:
1. The cell (1,1) has a mine count of 2 among its neighboring cells.
2. The cell (0,2) has a mine count of 1 among its neighboring cells.
3. Based on these insights, we see that (0,1) and (1,2) should definitely have at least one mine each.

Given this:
- The cell (0,0) is adjacent to (1, 1), which needs two mines around it, and (0,2) which needs one around it. Because we have noted that (0,1) or (1,2) could be mines, (0,0) seems likely to be unsafe to open.

Instead, the focus should be on cells that provide pivotal evidence and pose lesser threat of having multiple mines within proximity. Computational analysis should guide us to start-off tentatively.

---CORRECTION ACTION---
Considering the safer bet amidst coverage constraints:
- The cell (1,3) is distant from highly influence count cells such as (1,1) with valid two mines. Thus, can relatively prove new safe information.

ACTION: open 1 3
