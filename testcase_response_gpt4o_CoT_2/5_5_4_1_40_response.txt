To determine the next action, we need to analyze the given Minesweeper board. First, let's visualize the current state and look for any logical deductions we can make based on the revealed numbers:

```
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
1 1 1 1 1 
0 0 0 0 0 
```

Next, let's review the clues provided by the opened cells in the bottom rows.

1. The cells at positions (4,0) through (4,4) are all 0s. This means none of these cells have a mine, nor do their neighbors.
2. The cells at positions (3,0) through (3,4) are all 1s. These cells indicate that each of them has exactly one mine in their neighboring cells.

Given this situation, we should evaluate the neighbors of the "1" cells to determine if any deductions about mine locations can be made.

### Conclusion:
1. The cells that are neighbors to the series of "1" cells are potentially mines. But since all uncovered cells next to our 1s suggest exactly one mine, it means one of the remaining covered neighbor cells must be a mine.
2. The bottom row of "0" cells guarantees safety in choosing neighboring cells around these already confirmed 0s.

Hence, opening any one of the neighboring cells of 0 should be safe.

Consider cell (2,0):
This cell is a neighbor to cell (3,0) having clear safety from bottom '0' cell and '1' mine value suggests only one neighboring mine, yet all neighbors around (3,1) indicates safe attempt.

ACTION: open 2 0
