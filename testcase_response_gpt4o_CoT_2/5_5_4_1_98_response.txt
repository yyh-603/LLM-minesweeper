Given the current table state, let's infer the next safest action to take.

TABLE:
```
. . . . . 
1 1 2 . . 
0 0 1 . . 
0 1 2 . . 
0 1 . . . 
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Look at the numbers and their unopened neighbors:**
   - From the board, we know:
     - Cell (1,0) has 1 neighboring mine
     - Cell (1,1) has 1 neighboring mine
     - Cell (1,2) has 2 neighboring mines
     - Cell (2,2) has 1 neighboring mine
     - Cell (3,1) has 1 neighboring mine
     - Cell (3,2) has 2 neighboring mines
     - Cell (4,1) has 1 neighboring mine
     
2. **Analyze the corners and their neighboring cells with numbers:**
   - Cell (1,0) shows 1, so one of its neighbors (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1) must be mines. 
   - Since cells (2,0) and (2,1) are 0, they have no mines, making the situation clear that cell (1,1) or cells (0,0), (0,1) must have mines.
   - Cell (1,1) has to be the mine since adjacent cells (1,0) and cell (2,1) hints only one mine nearby, and this mine is accounted by cell (1,1).
     
3. **Considering the Mines:**
   - By deduction, the number of mines equal to cell's number 2 in cell (1,2) hints that cell (1,3) and cell (0,2) must be flagged as they are only two cells left in unopened state.

4. **Safest Move Analysis:**
   - According to known safe cells with zero mines indications vertically and horizontally along with diagonals. 
   - Next safest move would be opening cells nearest to cells with zero inclusions justified safe zones.

Best action to open for safety given mines revealed and non-dangerous zone:

Reason:
 - Considering all aforementioned details, zero numbers around neighbors can hint that cell (3,4) must be opened next.

ACTION: open 3 4
