Based on the given TABLE and the Minesweeper rules, let's analyze the board step by step.

The provided board is:
```
. . . . .
. . . . .
. . . . .
1 1 1 1 .
0 0 0 1 .
```

By observing the current fields:

1. The cell at (4, 0) is 0, indicating that it and all its adjacent cells (if covered) are safe to open.
2. The cell at (3, 0) is 1, indicating there is exactly 1 mine nearby. Based on the adjacent covered cells, we still need more information to infer more mines or safe cells.

Since (4, 0) is a 0:
- All adjacent cells (4, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1) must be free of mines.

REASON:
Given the 0 in cell (4, 0), we know that the neighboring covered cells (4, 1), (3, 0), and (3, 1) are safe to open. 

ACTION: open 4 1
