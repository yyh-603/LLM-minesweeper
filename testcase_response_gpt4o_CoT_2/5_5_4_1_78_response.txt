REASON: Given the current board state:

```
0 0 1 . . 
1 1 1 . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
```

The cell at (1, 4) and (1, 3) indicates the number of neighboring mines. The cells at (1, 0), (1, 1), and (1, 2) already have numbers indicating one adjacent mine, suggesting that the neighboring cells (0, 3) and (1, 3) could be unsafe. Similarly, the cell at (0, 2) has 1 neighboring mine which means that the mine is placed one of the positions in its surrounding 8 cells.

Since the top two rows indicate only a single neighboring mine nearby both (0, 2) position and (1, 2) position, the safest move would be to open a location that is far from the already provided clues. 

The safest move would be to open a cell at the non-indicated corner such as (2, 0) which is an empty cell opening.

ACTION: open 2 0

CORRECTION REASON:
The given reason and action suggest opening a cell (2, 0) because it is far from the already provided clues with numbers indicating possible neighboring mines. The board state shows that the first two rows are well-explored, and opening cells far from these rows minimizes the risk of encountering mines based on provided numbers and covered cells' positions.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 2 0
