------- 0th response -------
REASON: The cell at (0, 2) has no neighboring mines (it is 0). When there is a 0, it indicates there are no mines in any neighboring cells. Therefore, we can safely open the nearby covered cells. Let's start by opening the cell at (0, 1).

ACTION: open 0 1
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason is valid. The cell at (0, 2) with no neighboring mines (indicated by 0) implies that the neighboring cells are also safe to open. However, the current board state indicates that cell (0, 1) is already opened because it shows a number "1." So, instead of opening an already opened cell, we should open another covered cell that is adjacent to a known "0" cell. Indeed, all neighboring cells around (0, 2) should be safe to open.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 0 0
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing action is invalid because the cell at (0, 1) is already opened, as indicated by the number "1". Therefore, we cannot open an already opened cell. Instead, we should consider opening one of the covered cells adjacent to the known "0" cell at (0, 2), as all such cells should be safe to open.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 0 1
