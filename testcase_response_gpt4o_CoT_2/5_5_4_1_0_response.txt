Let's analyze the given table step by step and identify any safe moves or any cells that we can definitively flag as mines.

```
. . . . .
. 1 2 2 .
. 1 0 1 1
. 1 0 0 0
. 1 0 0 0
```

First, let's observe the cell at (1, 2) which has a value of 2. This means there are two mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (1, 2) are:

- (0, 1)
- (0, 2)
- (0, 3)
- (1, 1)
- (1, 3)
- (2, 1)
- (2, 2)
- (2, 3)

Out of these, the cells (2, 2) and (2, 3) are already opened and known to be safe (0 and 1 respectively). Thus, we only need to consider the following covered cells:

- (0, 1)
- (0, 2)
- (0, 3)
- (1, 1)
- (1, 3)
- (2, 1)

Now, considering the value 1 in cell (1, 1):

- The only unopened cells adjacent to (1, 1) are (0, 1) and (2, 1).
- Since cell (1, 1) has a value of 1, there is exactly one mine among these two cells (0, 1) or (2, 1).

Next, considering the value of 2 in cell (1, 2) which is still not fully utilized:

- Based on the analysis above, we already learned that either (0, 1) or (2, 1) has one mine.
- This leaves one more mine to be found among (0, 2) or (0, 3) or (1, 3).

Finally, look at cell (1, 3) with a value of 2:

- This cell has the following adjacent unopened cells: (0, 2), (0, 3).
- Since we have established that there is one mine in either (0, 2) or (0, 3) and another mine to look for in its adjacent cells, it simplifies to one of them being a mine.

As a deduction, one safe move we can make is to open cell (1, 4):

- Because it's right next to cell (1, 3), and no mine could be directly adjacent to it as both possible mines (adjacent to 1, 2) have been determined elsewhere.
- Also, in respect to the previously closed cells, (2, 4) or beyond cells are clear of current constraints with values.

REASON: In the current situation there are still potential mines to be identified in close cells based on clues or flagged safely. Opening the least connected entry or less marked cells (1, 4) helps in my safe approach.

ACTION: open 1 4
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: Given the current table, the action "open 1 4" is made under the assumption that it is the least connected or less marked cell. However, the cell at (1, 4) has a neighboring cell (2, 4) with a number. This implies there is potentially useful information here. 

We should actually focus on the clearly safe moves supported by existing numbers around known flagged cells. The cell at (2, 4) with a 1 suggests that there is exactly one mine in its proximity, and it includes one revealed flagged cell. However, based on current information, we can confidently say that cells around numbers should be considered thoroughly too.

For now, let's take a more clear step where we can gain information with fewer chances of hitting a mine. Opening around cells of `0` (as they propagate revelation for safe openings effectively) can be useful.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 2 0
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reasoning about the assumption of the action "open 1 4" being the least connected hence assumed least risky is indeed ambiguous without strong supporting evidence. Focus should first be on safe openings and clearly deduced movements around numbers and zeros to maximize safe exposures.

Considering cells around known `0` or low-numbered cells is a safe and strategic move. Specifically, the updated table provided shows that the cell at (2, 2) is `0` which means its neighboring cells can be opened safely.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 1 0
