REASON: Let's analyze the current board:

```
. 1 0 1 . 
. 1 0 1 . 
. 1 0 1 . 
. 2 1 1 . 
. . . . .
```

1. There are multiple cells that are already opened with numbers indicating the count of adjacent mines.
2. The cell at (3, 1) has a '2', meaning there are two mines adjacent to it. The potential candidate cells for mines are (2, 0), (2, 1), (4, 0), and (4, 1).
    - The cell (3, 0) is not flagged but is adjacent to this '2', making it a potential mine.
3. The cells (1, 0) and (2, 0) are still covered and adjacent to '1' clues.
4. Specifically, the '1' at (2, 1) already has one flagged adjacent cell at (3, 0), suggesting more safety in adjacent cells.

Following this observation, covering cells that do not align with the immediate mine proximity to the known '1' clues on identifying (3, 1) as the mine perimeter via increments to safety levels, revealing a likely safe open spot.

ACTION: open 0 0

CORRECTION REASON: The provided action suggests opening cell (0, 0) as it could be safe based on the analysis of clues from surrounded cells. However, let's re-evaluate the board step by step:

1. **Look at cell (3, 1)** which has a '2' next to it. The possible mines around it are in cells (2, 0), (2, 2), (4, 0), and (4, 2).
2. **Cell (2, 1)** has a '1', implying there is one mine around it. Given this, it points towards cell (3, 0) which could influence our pattern search with visibility flagged mines.
3. **Cell (1, 1)** and **Cell (2, 1)** both have only one adjoining mine as per clues, adding no further breach around cell (3, 0).
4. **Potential clue pattern of dispersal** around cells reveals cell (3, 0), (3, 2) possibly having flagging potential denoting coverage yet uncovered.

However, from the above, since cell (0, 0) appears isolated without critical flagged clues guiding mine criteria beyond logically perpendicular non-overlaps making it indeed logically sound hence we'll correct this observation if No contrary information repeatedly counterfoiling significant shakier perimeter.

Let's proceed making this move clear logically precise:
CORRECTION ACTION: open (0, 0)
