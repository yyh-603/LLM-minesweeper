Let's analyze the table step by step to determine the safest action.

TABLE:
```
. . 1 0 0 
. . 1 1 1 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
```

1. There is a `1` at (0, 2). This indicates there is 1 mine in the neighboring cells [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)].
2. The cell at (0, 0) and (0, 1) and (1, 0) and (1, 1) are covered.
3. The cell (0, 1) might be a mine as this cell borders the `1` clue at (0, 2).
4. Similarly, if we observe cell (1, 2) with value `1`, we can see that there could be a mine in either (0, 2), (1, 1) or (2, 2). But since (0, 2) is already revealed with value `1`, this confirms that the covered cells around (1, 2) which are (0, 1), (1, 1) and (2, 2) one of them might contain the mine.
5. Since cell at (1, 3) marked `1` there is only one mine around cell (1, 3)

Based on the above analysis, and considering that selecting (1, 1) or (1, 2) is risky with mine proximity, the safest choice here to reveal more information without risk is the empty cell far from mined areas. 

Thus, I will open cell (0, 0).

REASON: Based on the information from the 1 detections, (0, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 2) might contain mines. Given these combinations, (0, 0) is reasonably safe to open.

ACTION: `open 0 0`
