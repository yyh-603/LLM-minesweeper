Let's examine the provided table step by step and identify a safe cell to either open or flag, based on the available clues.

```
TABLE:
. . . . . 
1 1 1 2 . 
0 0 0 1 . 
1 1 1 1 . 
. . . . . 
```

We see the following relevant information:
- The cell at (3, 0) has a '1', indicating one neighboring mine.
- The cell at (3, 1) has a '1', indicating one neighboring mine.
- The cell at (3, 2) has a '1', indicating one neighboring mine.
- The cell at (3, 3) has a '1', indicating one neighboring mine.
- The cell at (2, 4) has a '1', indicating one neighboring mine.
- The cell at (1, 4) has a '2', indicating two neighboring mines.

#### Analyzing Some Cells:
1. Let's start from the second row first:
   - The cell at `(2, 0)` is '0', which means `all` neighboring cells around `(2, 0)` are mine-free.
   - The cell at `(2, 1)` is '0', further implying `all` neighboring cells around `(2, 1)` are mine-free.
   - The cell at `(2, 2)`, `(2, 3)` are '0's, so their neighbors are also mine-free.
   
   Hence, the neighboring cells around `(2, 0)` is mine-free and it is safe to open them.
   
#### Safe Move:
Based on the above analysis, let's choose to open one such clear cell that signals it can recursively open other clear cells forming cleared chunk.

REASON:
The cells around (2, 0) are all '0'. Hence, opening any such cell will safely reveal its neighborhood as well.

ACTION:
```
open 2 0
```
