Let's analyze the current table and derive the safest next move.

TABLE:
```
. . 1 0 0 
. . 1 0 0 
. . 1 1 1 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
```

We notice that the cell `(0, 2)` contains the number `1`, which means there is exactly 1 mine adjacent to it. The adjacent cells to `(0, 2)` are `(0, 1)`, `(0, 3)`, `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 3)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`.

However, since the only opened cell around `(0, 2)` is the number `0` at `(0, 3)`, it implies there is no mine around `(0, 3)`. This reduces the suspects to:

- `(0, 1)`: Covered
- `(1, 1)`: Covered
- `(1, 2)`: Covered but can't be a mine for cells `(0, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 2)` content would be more than one mine because more than two cells contain number 1.
- `(2, 1)`: Covered

Considering all these covered cells, the cell `(0, 1)` is safer to open.

REASON: Since cell `(0, 2)` has 1 neighboring mine and no other neighboring cells are opened around it, it reduces the possibility of `(0, 1)` being a mine.
  
ACTION: open 0 1

CORRECTION REASON: The reasoning is flawed because cell `(0, 1)` could still potentially contain a mine. The cell `(0, 2)` having 1 neighboring mine suggests that one of its adjacent covered cells (including `(1, 2)`) could be the mine.

Consider another cell, the cell `(2, 2)` has 1 neighboring mine, and the only other unopened neighboring cell is `(1, 3)`. Therefore, the mine must be in one of the unopened cells surrounding `(2, 2)`, but more information is needed.

However, we can open around safe areas. The cell `(0, 3)` has 0 neighboring mines, implying that we can safely open its neighboring cells recursively.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 0 3
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing reason suggests a flawed inference for the potential location of a mine. Instead, we should look at safer openings based on provided information. The cell `(0, 3)` contains a `0`, indicating all of its neighboring cells have no mines. Thus, it can be safely opened and will recursively open its neighbors.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 0 3
