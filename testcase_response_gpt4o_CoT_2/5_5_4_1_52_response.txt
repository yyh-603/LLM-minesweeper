------- 0th response -------
REASON: The cells at (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3) have 2 neighboring mines each. Observing the lower row, the cells at (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3) are still covered, and they are the only possible candidates for the mines. Since we have 3 covered cells and need to resolve 2 mines, we need to examine further steps from any other direction.
While this grid needs more moves to fully ensure the flagged cells, starting the ripple from any non-sensitive point ensures extended opening cells and minimizes random unrevealed points.

ACTION: open 2 4

CORRECTION REASON: The existing action does not align with the logical deduction needed to ensure safety and progress. Opening (2, 4) without additional information is not fully justified by the given clues. Instead, we can look for more straightforward deductions to avoid guessing.

Looking at the cells (1, 0), (1, 1), and (1, 2) which contain values of 2, 2, and 2 respectively, and recognizing that the cells in (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2) are connected, the immediate clear action would be to flag the cells that are determined as adjacent, thus clearing the path for subsequent steps and maintaining game flow.

CORRECTION ACTION: flag 2 1
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (1, 0) and (1, 1) both have 2 neighboring mines. Considering cells (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2), it is clear that two of the cells in the row right below must be mines. The only cells that can be safely flagged in the row below (i.e., row 2) around cells (1, 0) and (1, 1).

CORRECTION ACTION: flag 2 0
