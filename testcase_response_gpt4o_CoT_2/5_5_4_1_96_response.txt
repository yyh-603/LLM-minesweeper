REASON: The cell at (1, 1) has '2' neighboring mines. Among its neighboring cells, we have two covered cells: (0, 2) and (1, 2). Since there are no other mines around this cell, we need to flag these cells to mark them as mines. The same reasoning is observed at the cell (1, 1) and the surrounding cells from (1, 0) -> (2, 0).

This identifies:
- Cell (0, 2) as a definite mine.
- Cell (1, 2) as a definite mine.

Thus, I will flag these cells.

ACTION: flag 0 2

CORRECTION REASON: The logic presented has some errors, and it does not clearly demonstrate how to infer that cells (0, 2) and (1, 2) are definite mines. The correct action can be deduced with proper investigation.

Since the cell at (1, 1) has '2' neighboring mines and its neighboring cells are (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 2), let's examine that area precisely.

Note:
- (0, 0) is 0 = no mines around.
- (0, 1) is 1 = one mine around.
All possible neighbors are provided then `0, 2` and `1, 2` follow:
- (0 + 0) = (1 + covered) = (2 - 1 neighbor) = { (1, 1) - (2 - 1 neighbor) } => Neighbor cell-influence AND site(covered-cell) infers DEDUCTION true.

Therefore based on reasoning:
- (0, 2) has been one mine.
- But we should flag cell {1, 2} guarantees' ONE since ambiguous cover-miscount was resolving maximal prompt.

Based on investigation "defensible flag-focused flag," next move should align confirmed excess in analysis scope.

CORRECTION ACTION: `flag 1 2`
