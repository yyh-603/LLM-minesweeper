Let's analyze the given Minesweeper table step by step to identify the safest move. 

The table is as follows:

```
. . . . . 
1 1 1 1 . 
0 0 0 1 . 
1 2 1 1 . 
. . . . . 
```

First, we analyze the numbers and try to deduce the locations of mines:

1. The cell (1, 0) is '1', which means that one of its neighboring cells contains a mine.
2. The neighboring cells of (1, 0) are (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), and (2, 1). As (1, 1) itself is '1', there will be one mine among its other neighbors.
3. Similarly, the (2, 1) is '2', meaning it has two neighboring mines, and the covered cells around (2, 1) are (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), and (4, 1). But since (1, 1) is '1' and open, the cells (2, 0) and (3, 0) might not be mines.

Now let's deduce the safe moves:
- If we evaluate cell (2, 0) and if it doesn't have a mine, the decreased '2' value rule confirms (3, 0) as mine.

However, with limited information on mines at these positions and moving unsafely, we might proceed:
- The safest and calculated move could be (3, 2).

REASON: The cell at (3, 2) is likely a safe cell to open as the number of neighboring mines is indicated, reducing the probability of it containing a mine.

ACTION: open 3 2
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (3, 2) having the number "2" indicates that it has two neighboring mines. Given that cells (3, 1) and (2, 2) are already known to be safe, the remaining cells (3, 3) and (4, 3) are more likely candidates for being unsafe. Thus, opening cell (3, 2) is not a safe action as it could reasonably contain a mine.

A better action in this scenario would be to open cells with no adjacent mines or cells that are more obvious due to neighboring hints.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 1 4
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The reasoning provided appears to contain a misunderstanding. The cell at (3, 2) is already open and showing a "2," indicating two neighboring mines. Since (3, 1) and (2, 2) being adjacent adds nothing to infer new mines, the cells (3, 3) and (4, 3) remain possible mine positions. The given action, "open 1 4," is invalid because it might be inappropriately treating a covered cell without supporting evidence.

CORRECTION ACTION: To draw a valid conclusion and infer safe moves, examining cells with neutral numbers to possible mine flags is required.

Given that (2, 2) and (3, 1) are safe, it¡¦d be sensible to identify completely clear areas or those least bound by hints to minimize risk:

- An unflagged or broadly reasoned cell, such as (0, 1). Alternatively, a similar openable/clearly probable-safe choice.

ACTION: open 0 1
