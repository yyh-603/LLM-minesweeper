Let's analyze the current Minesweeper table step by step to infer a safe action:

```
TABLE:
. . 1 0 0 
. . 1 0 0 
. 2 1 0 0 
. 1 0 0 0 
. 1 0 0 0 
```

REASON:
1. We start with the uncovered cells to gather clues:
   - The cell at (0, 2) has a value of 1, indicating it has 1 neighboring mine.
   - The cell at (1, 2) also has a value of 1, indicating it has 1 neighboring mine.
   - The cell at (2, 1) has a value of 2, indicating it has 2 neighboring mines.
   - The cell at (2, 2) has a value of 1, indicating it has 1 neighboring mine.
   - The cells at (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4) have values of 0, indicating no neighboring mines.

2. Let's consider the clues around the cell at (2, 1) with a value of 2:
   - The neighboring cells of (2, 1) are:
       - (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)
       - (2, 0), (2, 2)
       - (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)
   - The cell at (2, 0) is covered, and so are (1, 0) and (1, 1).
   - Because it is surrounded by cells holding flags, we need to gather more clues from around the cell at (2, 2) with a value of 1. 

3. Considering the cells near cell at (2, 2) with value 1:
   - The neighboring cells of (2, 2) are:
       - (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)
       - (2, 1), (2, 3)
       - (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
   - The cells (2, 3) and (2, 4) both have value of 0, and no nearby mines.
   - The curious cell would be opening (2, 3), which indicates no mines near.

Given the clues revealed, opening an edge cell with a nearby cell indicating zero mines would be safe. 

ACTION: open 2 3
