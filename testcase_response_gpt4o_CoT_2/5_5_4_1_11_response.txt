REASON: Looking at the current table:

```
. . . . . 
1 1 2 . . 
0 0 1 . . 
1 2 1 . . 
. . . . . 
```

We can infer the following:

- The cell at (1, 2) shows "2", meaning it has 2 neighboring mines. The neighboring cells are (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3).

- Most of these cells are covered except (1, 1) and (2, 2) which are opened and safe.

- The cell at (2, 2) is "1", and we can infer that one of the neighboring cells should be a mine. No mines are flagged yet but knowing the safe cell at (2, 1) and (2, 3).

Additional observation:

Since we don't have enough certain information from just (1, 2) with "2", the simplest safe move for more clues would be:

- The cell at (2, 0) is next to "0," then it is safe. It will open neighboring cells as well:

ACTION: open 2 0

CORRECTION REASON:
The action to open (2, 0) is indeed a safe move. However, let's carefully reconsider the strategy by analyzing all the information from the revealed numbers on the board.

Given the current board:
```
. . . . . 
1 1 2 . . 
0 0 1 . . 
1 2 1 . . 
. . . . . 
```

### Analysis:
1. **Cell (1, 1) is "1"**:
   - The neighboring cells are: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2).
   - Since (1, 1) is "1" and there is only one safe cell around (0, 0), indicating some potential unsafe areas.

2. **Cell (1, 2) is "2"**:
   - The neighboring cells are: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3).
   - Cells (1, 2) and (2, 2) tell us there are more mines around.

3. **Cell (2, 1) is "0"**:
   - Means we can safely open its neighboring cells: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2).
   - These are already clear and should be moved on.

Given this information, the safest step with additional clue and minimum risk appears to be:
1. **Cell (2, 0)** is an absolute safe move because it¡¦s next to a zero.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 2 0
