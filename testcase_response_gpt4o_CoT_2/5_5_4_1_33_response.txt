Sure, let's analyze the given board step-by-step. 

Current state of the board:
```
. 1 0 0 0 
. 1 1 1 1 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . .
```

We need to identify cells that we can safely open or cells that we should flag. Let's start with the numbers already revealed:

1. The cell at (1, 1) has the number `1`, meaning it has one neighboring mine. Its neighboring cells are:
   - (0, 0)
   - (0, 1)
   - (0, 2)
   - (1, 0)
   - (1, 2)
   - (2, 0)
   - (2, 1)
   - (2, 2)

    However, (1, 1) itself is considered a neighboring cell here.

2. The cell at (1, 2) also has the number `1`, meaning it has one neighboring mine. Its neighboring cells are:
   - (0, 1)
   - (0, 2)
   - (0, 3)
   - (1, 1)
   - (1, 3)
   - (2, 1)
   - (2, 2)
   - (2, 3)

3. The cell at (1, 3) has the number `1`, meaning it has one neighboring mine. Its neighboring cells are:
   - (0, 2)
   - (0, 3)
   - (0, 4)
   - (1, 2)
   - (1, 4)
   - (2, 2)
   - (2, 3)
   - (2, 4)

4. The cell at (1, 4) has the number `1`, meaning it has one neighboring mine. Its neighboring cells are:
   - (0, 3)
   - (0, 4)
   - (1, 3)
   - (2, 3)
   - (2, 4)

Analyzing each clue:

- The cell at (1, 1) indicates one mine in its adjacent cells, which can be any of the covered cells surrounding it, such as (0, 0), (1, 0).
- It is the same for the other cells (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 4).

Interestingly, for cells (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 4), since there are no adjacent `1` cells, it is improbable to contain a mine. Thus, the cell (0, 0) or (1, 0) should contain the mine indicated by (1, 1).

**So we should flag** one of these two cells. To better identify the safer candidate cell, let us properly evaluate our existing steps into multiple rounds.

REASON: To avoid risk initially and to verify clues certainty, flagging cell could provide better guidance to our next move.
ACTION: `flag 0 0`
