REASON: The cell at (1, 1) has 2 neighboring mines, and currently, it has 2 neighboring covered cells at (0, 0) and (0, 1). Given that the cell at (1, 1) indicates the presence of exactly 2 mines among its neighbors, both (0, 0) and (0, 1) are confirmed to be mines. Hence, we'll flag these cells to avoid opening them.

ACTION: flag 0 0

Upon reviewing the given information and reasoning:

Your logic is partially correct. The cell at (1, 1) does indeed have 2 neighboring mines among its neighbors. However, both cells at (0, 0) and (1, 0) are the ones that are currently covered. Therefore, we should flag these two cells as mines.

**CORRECTION REASON:** The cell at (1, 1) has 2 neighboring mines, and currently, the covered cells are at (0, 0) and (1, 0). Given that the cell at (1, 1) indicates the presence of exactly 2 mines among its neighbors, both (0, 0) and (1, 0) are confirmed to be mines. Hence, we'll flag these cells to avoid opening them.

**CORRECTION ACTION:** 
1. flag 0 0
2. flag 1 0
