Given the given Minesweeper board, let's analyze it to determine the next safest move.

The current board state is:
```
. . . . . 
1 1 1 . . 
0 0 1 . . 
0 0 2 . . 
0 0 2 . .
```

### Analysis:
- The cell at (1, 0) is a "1", and it has only one covered cell around it (0, 0).
- The cell at (1, 1) is a "1", and it has only one covered cell around it (0, 1).
- The cell at (1, 2) is a "1", and the cells (0, 1) and (0, 2) are covered.
- The cell at (2, 2) is a "1", and it has only one covered cell around it (1, 3).
- The cells at (3, 2) and (4, 2) are "2"s, and the cells (2, 2) and (1, 2) are known to be safe.

Considering the first two observations:
1. The cell (1, 0) being "1" means there is one mine, and it's only possible neighbor is (0, 0). Therefore, (0, 0) is a mine.
2. The cell (1, 1) being "1" means there is one mine around, and we already assume (0, 0) is a mine, so (0, 1) should not be a mine.

Given these conditions, we flag the known mine and proceed.

### Decision:
- Flag cell (0, 0) because it's a mine.

**REASON:** The cell at (1, 0) has 1 neighboring mine, and only one neighboring cell (0, 0) is not opened, making it the mine. We flag it.

**ACTION:** 
```
flag 0 0
```
