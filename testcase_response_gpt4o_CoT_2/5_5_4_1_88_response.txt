To solve the current Minesweeper problem, let's analyze the provided table:

```
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
1 2 . 2 1 
0 1 1 1 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
```

1. The cell at (2, 1) shows a ¡§2,¡¨ indicating that there are 2 mines in the adjacent cells.
2. The cell at (3, 1) shows a ¡§1,¡¨ indicating that there is 1 mine in the adjacent cells.
3. The cell at (3, 2) shows a ¡§1,¡¨ indicating that there is 1 mine in the adjacent cells.
4. The cell at (2, 3) shows a ¡§2,¡¨ indicating that there are 2 mines in the adjacent cells.
   
By analyzing these pieces of information, we can see that:

- The cell at (2, 1) has 2 adjacent covered cells: (2, 0), (2, 2), and (3, 1).
- The cell at (3, 1) has 3 adjacent covered cells: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2).

Since cell (3, 1) indicates presence of only one mine, it means of (2, 1) and (2, 2) only one contains a mine:
- The cell at (2, 3) has 1 mine and its neighboring cells (2, 2) and (3, 3).

Moving through it step-by-step:
- Since cell (3, 2) shows "1" indicating only one mine, it means of (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1) only one contains mine.

Thus, one possible move appears to be flagging (2, 2), which fulfill the mine count:
Reasoning indicates the move would be flagging cell covering mine which matches mine values in this region.


ACTION: flag 2 2
