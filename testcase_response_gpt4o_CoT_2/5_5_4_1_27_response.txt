Let's analyze the current Minesweeper board:

```
TABLE:
0 0 1 . . 
0 1 2 . . 
0 1 . . . 
0 1 1 2 . 
0 0 0 1 .
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identifying Cells with Clear Actions**:
   - Starting with cells that display numbers such as `2` and `1`:
   1. Cell (2, 1) shows `1` -> We know one of its neighboring cells (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 1) is flagged or has a mine.
   2. Cell (1, 2) shows `2` -> It is bordered by cells (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)

2. **Identifying Mines and Safe Cells**:
   - (1, 2) = `2` indicating it has two mines in its neighbors.
   - (0, 2) = `1` indicating it has one mine.
   - (0, 4) = Empty, so trying to find any patterns of intersections.

3. **Confirm Mines and Proceed**:
   - By tracing around known mines listed with the numbers and empty safe zones.
   - (0, 2) vertically and (0, 3), diagonally provides no solid intersections as constraints but, borders between notifications highlight the safe bet from resultant mine count approach.

### Conclusion:
   - The cell at (3, 4) is predicted safe to engage flagged checks borderness.

REASON: Based on the inspected constraints and number counts leading towards isolated safe bets as an intersection while calculating safely via constraints verified mine locations.

ACTION: open 4 4
------- 1th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The reasoning provided does not logically connect the existing information on the board to the proposed action. The cell at (4, 4) does not have sufficient surrounding information from opened cells to safely determine that it is not a mine.

By analyzing the current known information:
- Cell (3, 3) has a count of 2 neighboring mines, with one already open (1 at (4, 3)).
- Cell (1, 2) has a count of 2 neighboring mines, with one already open (1 at (2, 2)).

It appears that confirming further information near cells with 1s that have all neighbors revealed as non-mines may be safer.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 4 3
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The cell at (4, 3) already displays a '1', indicating it has no mines adjacent to it that are covered. Therefore, opening (4, 3) will not change the state of the game. Additionally, cells with a 1 are not conclusively safe to open unless all but one of their surrounding cells have been flagged or opened, which hasn't been demonstrated here.

To elaborate further:
- The cell at (3, 1) is showing a 1 and the only unopened cell adjacent to it is (2, 0), so opening (2, 0) is safe.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 2 0
