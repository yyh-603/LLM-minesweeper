To solve this, we need to analyze the current information on the board.

First, note the important cells:
- The cell at (2, 1) has a '3', indicating it has 3 neighboring mines.
- The cell at (2, 2) has a '2', indicating it has 2 neighboring mines.
- The cell at (3, 1) has a '2', indicating it has 2 neighboring mines.
- The cell at (4, 1) has a '2', indicating it has 2 neighboring mines.

Let's focus on the cell at (2, 1) with '3'. This cell indicates that there are 3 mines in its neighboring cells:
- (1, 0) - covered
- (1, 1) - covered
- (1, 2) - covered
- (2, 0) - covered
- (2, 2) - already counted ('2')
- (3, 0) - covered
- (3, 1) - already counted ('2')
- (3, 2) - covered

Given this, the remaining numbers provide additional constraints. The '2' at (2, 2) and '2' at (3, 1):
- Neighbors of (2, 2): (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
- Neighbors of (3, 1): (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
- Neighbors of (4, 1): (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)

From the '3' at (2, 1) and '2' at other positions, we can infer the mines around it. 

Given any valid inference, we can open additional cells or flag them based on mutual information of the covered cells and their expected bomb count.

Based on this:
- The neighboring cells with the possibility of being mines based on coverage are highly around the intersection cells of 1st and 2nd columns covering identifiers.

Safer action to: considering **open** neighboring top-left quadrant prior to revealing.

**Explicitly Action** mandated:

REASON: Because the cell at (3, 1) has 2 neighboring mines, and we know (around open-safe of counted indices grid references) next covered around (3,0).
ACTION: open 3 0

**CORRECTION REASON:** The reason provided is incorrect. The cell at (3, 1) has 2 neighboring mines, but no further inference about the neighboring cells is directly possible from (3, 1). The cells (2, 0) and (4, 0) are more obvious choices since the adjacent cell from respective opened values confirm that these cells must contain mines. Highlighting that, there are aforementioned inferred cell openings involved to assert logical next feasible actions examining opened reliable non-mined cell possibilities.

Taking a more appropriate and safe approach:

- The cell at (2, 1) with a count of 3 mines and visible adjacent non-mined cell: Confirms a positional safe opening cell around better infered candidate analogous non-compulsive open cell at (1, 1) midst of cells align this perspective from infered safer non-mined cells to concentrate actions leading future probabilities or sequence inferable further mined estimations downstrategic implementations elaborated ahead.

Given no sidereferences from intercell engagement inferential safety aggregate opening assumption:

For better next inference analogous cells around safe annotations:
Consulting the opened value ensuring (3, 0) no seeming external rationale or mined proximal probability availiable actions inferred from else comprehensive safe open revisions forward:

**CORRECTION ACTION:** open 1 1
