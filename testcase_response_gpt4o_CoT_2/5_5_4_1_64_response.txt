Let's analyze the provided Minesweeper board step by step to decide the safest action:

TABLE:
. . . . . 
1 1 1 1 . 
0 0 0 1 1 
2 2 1 0 0 
. . 1 0 0 

1. The cell at (2, 1) shows `0`, which means it has no neighboring mines, implying that its neighboring cells could be safe to open.
2. The neighboring cells to (2, 1) are: 
   - (1, 0), (1, 1), 
   - (2, 0), 
   - (3, 0), (3, 1).
   
Since (3, 0) and (3, 1) have a clue indicating `2` nearby mines, cells that are potentially safe to open are the other neighbors. 

Given that (1, 0), (1, 1) are already opened and indicated as `1`, and (2, 0) is covered.

3. By considering cells (2, 1) and (3, 1) with `0` and `2` respectively:
   - (3, 1) suggests there are mines in nearby cells, including (4, 0) and (4, 1).

Thus, it is safe to perform:
ACTION: open 3 4

However, since (3, 1) suggests two mines, additional safe consideration should imply focusing opening on less potential high-risk cells due to the dataset constraints. The subsequent safest initial action without ambiguous risk should include the least likely obvious covered cell adjoining `0`.

ACTION: open 2 0
