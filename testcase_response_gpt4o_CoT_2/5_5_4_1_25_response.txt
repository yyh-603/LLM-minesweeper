Let's analyze the current table and determine our next move.

### Current Table:
```
.  .  .  .  .  
1  2  .  .  .  
0  1  2  .  .  
0  0  1  2  .  
0  0  0  1  .  
```

### Analysis:

1. **Cell (0, 0):**
   - Contains a number: 1.
   - It has one mine in its neighboring cells.
   
2. **Cell (0, 1):**
   - Contains a number: 2.
   - It has two mines in its neighboring cells.
   
3. **Cell (1, 0):**
   - Contains a number: 0.
   - It has no mines in its neighboring cells, and hence all its neighboring cells can be opened.

4. **Cell (1, 1):**
   - Contains a number: 2.
   - It has two mines in its neighboring cells.

Looking at Cell (1, 1) which has a number `2` it means both `(0, 0)` and `(0, 1)` have mines.

However considering cell `(1,0)` it has no mines around it and therefore the immediate surrounding cells are free of mines to open.

### Conclusion:
- We can safely open cell `(1, 2)` because it is too adjacent to cell `(1, 1)` which has the value `2` ensuring this area won't contain any mines otherwise previous inference would contradict.

### Final Decision:

REASON: Based on cell `(1, 0)` which has a value `0`, we can be sure that the cells `(0, 2)`, `(1, 2)`,and `(2, 2)` are safe. Therefore, most logical starting cell would be `(1, 2)`. 

ACTION: open 1 2

CORRECTION REASON: The given reason is incorrect. The cell at (1, 0) has a value of '1', not '0'. This means there is one mine in the neighboring cells. However, looking at the rest of the cells, there is no conclusive evidence to state that (1, 2) is completely safe. 

Let's re-evaluate:

- Cell (2, 2) has the value '2' and is next to the covered cells (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3). Two mines are adjacent to (2, 2).

A more logical action is focusing on the given safe opportunity around cells with low numbers. For instance, 

- Cell (3, 0) has a '0', making the neighboring cells (3, 1), (2, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1) safe to open or explore further.

CORRECTION ACTION: open 3 1
------- 2th response -------
CORRECTION REASON: The existing table and reasoning do not logically lead to determining any specific cell as safe or unsafe based on the provided clues. Reevaluating the information:

- Cell (2,2) has the number '2' and adjacent covered cells (1,2), (2,3), and (3,3).
- Cell (3,3) has the number '2' and adjacent covered cells (2,3), (3,4).

A better approach might be examining cells adjacent to those with '0' or fewer neighboring mines to expand the safe zones recursively.

Since cell (3,0) is '0', its neighboring cells are likely safe:

- Cells neighboring (3,0) are (3,1), (2,1), (4,0), and (4,1). 

ACTION: open 4 0
