REASON: The cells on the top and left edges have been opened and contain no neighboring mines except for the count provided by the already opened cells, which is all 0. Thus, we can see that the middle cells do not have any mines in the adjacent covered cells. The cell (2, 0) appears to be the safest cell to open because it's adjacent to the cells with the lowest numbers or zero, making it the most likely to have fewer mines around it.

ACTION: open 2 0

CORRECTION REASON: 
The given reasoning appears to have misinterpreted the situation slightly. The table "0 0 0 0 0", "1 1 2 1 1" and examining cell (2, 0) does not provide a certain inference about adjacent mines. However, given that cell (1, 0) indicates "1" and cell (1, 1) indicates "1", the middle cells in the third row likely do not contain mines.

CORRECTION ACTION:
Based on the current reasoning, a safer move would be to open (2, 2), because cells (0,2), (1,2), (2,3), and (2,4) indicate "0", which means no mines are around these cells and these information from the opened cells and remaining covered cells suggest no mines at (2, 2).
