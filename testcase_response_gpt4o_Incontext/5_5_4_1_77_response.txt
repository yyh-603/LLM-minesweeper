REASON: Let's analyze the current board. We have the following indications:
- The cells (0, 0) and (0, 1) are "0", indicating no mines around them. Any adjacent covered cells to these zeros should be safe to open.
- As (0, 0) = 0 and (0, 1) = 0, we can further open their adjacent cells. Specifically (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), as these are adjacent to zeros which ensure there are no mines around.

ACTION: open 0 2
