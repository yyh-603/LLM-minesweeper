REASON: The cell at (3, 3) has a value of 1, which means it has one neighboring mine. The only neighboring cell that is not opened is the cell at (2, 3), which is covered. From this, we can deduce that the mine must be located at (2, 3). Hence, we can safely mark this cell with a flag.

ACTION: flag 2 3
