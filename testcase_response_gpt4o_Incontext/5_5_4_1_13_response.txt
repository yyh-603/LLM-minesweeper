REASON: In the given table, the cell at (0, 1) shows the number 1, indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. No other numbers around (0, 1) have been revealed to positively identify a mine based on current information. Therefore, we need to look at other revealed numbers to make a safe move.

The cell at (1, 2) shows the number 2, indicating 2 neighboring mines. The neighboring cells of (1, 2) are (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3). The cells (1, 1) and (0, 1) are not mines (otherwise they would not show numbers), which means the remaining neighboring covered cells of (1, 2) must contain the mines.

Specifically, (0, 2), (1, 3) and (2, 3) are the remaining cells. Since there are 2 mines around (1, 2) and we already flagged 1 mine, and (1, 0) which is 0 gives us (0,2) there is no mine there. 

Thus, I can safely open cell (0, 2).

ACTION: open 0 2
