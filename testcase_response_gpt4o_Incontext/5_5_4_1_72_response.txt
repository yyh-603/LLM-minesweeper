REASON: The cell at (1, 4) has 2 neighboring mines, and since only three of its neighbors are covered, the two of them must contain the mines. Thus, the two mine cells must be in (2, 3) and (2, 4). This leaves only one neighboring cell, (2, 2), which should be safe to open. Additionally, the cell at (2, 3) must also be a mine because it's the only other cell adjacent to both the number 2 and number 3 cells.

ACTION: flag 2 3
