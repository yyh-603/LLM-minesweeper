Given the Minesweeper board, let's analyze each open cell and the possible configurations of the surrounding covered cells to deduce which cells are safe to open or should be flagged.

We begin by examining the known numbers and their surrounding covered cells to infer where the mines are located.

### Current Analysis:
1. **Cell (2, 2):** It shows `1`.
   - Possible mine positions: (2, 3) or (3, 3).

2. **Cell (1, 3):** It shows `1`.
   - Possible mine position: (2, 3) (already considered above).

3. **Cell (3, 2):** It shows `3`.
   - Surrounding cells: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4).

From this, we know:
- The three surrounding covered cells around (3, 2) must contain three mines. Since (4, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4) are out of consideration (empty state), the mines must be around (3, 3) and (3, 4).

Based on cell (2, 2) hinting at `1`, only one of these possibilities holds true within cell (3, 3).

Hence, let's mark the initial most probable mine position taken from inference which is:

**REASON:**
Based on the number clues provided by the open cells:
  - Cell (2, 2) showing `1` means the cell at (3, 3) or (2, 3) contains one mine.
  - Cell (3, 2) showing `3` means there are three mines within the surrounding cells. Given (4, 2) and (4, 3) are inaccessible (empty state), the adjacent cells (3, 3) and (3, 4) tend to have three mine allocation structure.

Thus, flagging the cell:
**ACTION:** flag 3 3
