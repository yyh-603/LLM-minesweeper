REASON: The cell at (0, 1) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (1, 1) also has 1 neighboring mine. The only unopened cells around them are (0, 2) and (1, 2). Given this, it is highly probable that one of these cells is a mine. However, the cell at (2, 2) has 2 neighboring mines, and the only unopened cells around it are (1, 2) and (2, 3). If we open (1, 2) safely, we can avoid guessing and gather more information.

ACTION: open 1 2
