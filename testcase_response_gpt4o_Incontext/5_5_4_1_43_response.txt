REASON: The cells at (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 4) all have numbers indicating 1 or 2 neighboring mines. However, since the cells in the first row (0, 0 to 0, 4) are already opened and all are zeros, meaning they have no neighboring mines, we can safely deduce that the cells directly below them in the second row (2, 0 to 2, 4) should contain mines. 
Nevertheless, to safely proceed without immediately flagging any cell, we can start by opening the neighboring cells that are more likely to be safe. 

Considering this, let's safely open a cell around those zeros in the first row.
