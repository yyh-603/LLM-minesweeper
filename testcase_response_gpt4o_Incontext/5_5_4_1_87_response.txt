REASON: The cell at (1, 2) has 2 neighboring mines, and the cell at (1, 3) has 1 neighboring mine. Since only one of the covered cells in their neighborhood can be a mine, the cell at (3, 2) must be a mine. Given this, the remaining cells in the area around (1, 3) having only 1 mine must not be it. Let¡¦s flag the cell at (3, 2).

ACTION: flag 3 2
