Let's analyze the current Minesweeper board:

```
TABLE:
. . . . .
. . . . .
. . . . .
. . . 2 1
. . . 1 0
```

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The cell at position (3, 3) shows the number 2, which means it has two neighboring mines in the 8 surrounding cells.

2. The cell at position (3, 4) shows the number 1, which means it has one neighboring mine.

3. The cell at position (4, 3) shows the number 1, which means it has one neighboring mine.

4. The cell at position (4, 4) shows the number 0, which means it has no neighboring mines. Therefore, all surrounding cells of (4, 4) must be safe to open.

Since (4, 4) is 0, it's safe to open the surrounding cells of (4, 4). The available covered cells around (4, 4) are (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), and (4, 4). Opening (4, 4) should cascade open the surrounding safe cells.

**Conclusion:**

The safest initial move is to "open 4 4".

**ACTION:**
```
ACTION: open 4 4
```
