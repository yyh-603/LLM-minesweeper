REASON: The cell at (0, 1) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell at (0, 2) is still covered. From the other parts of the board, it is clear that opening (0, 2) could be risky. However, the cell at (1, 2) also has 1 neighboring mine, and the cell already confirmed with neighboring mine is still (0, 2). Since the cell at (3, 0) is opened and has 1 neighboring mine, let's note the adjacent covered cell coordinate (4, 1), having similar covered cell (4, 0). Observing carefully, the cell at (2, 2) shows 1 already available mine clue, and the only logical confined area of (3, 0) cell leads to safe open action at (2, 3) where no promising existent mine logical context neighbor.

ACTION: open 2 3
