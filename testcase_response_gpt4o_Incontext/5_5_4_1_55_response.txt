REASON: The cells at (3, 3) and (4, 3) both have a number "1", indicating that there is 1 neighboring mine in each of their adjacent cells. Given that the cell at (2, 3) is also marked with "1", and all the other adjacent cells are covered, we can deduce that the most probable location of these mines could be the cells that are mutually adjacent to these "1" cells. Since all the cells neighboring (3, 3) and (4, 3) are currently covered and there is no complete certainty about any specific mine locations, it also means opening a border cell like (0, 0) or (0, 1) would be safer starting points without immediately risking opening a mine.
