REASON: Let's analyze the board step by step. 

1. The cell at (2, 2) shows '2', indicating it has two neighboring mines. 
2. The cell at (2, 1) shows '1', indicating it has one neighboring mine, and we can see it is already done with sufficient number of flagged cells.
3. The cell at (2, 0) also shows '1', indicating it has one neighboring mine.

Focusing on cell (3, 3) which shows '2'. This cell has two neighboring mines around it. With that, we know the adjacent covered cells around should be flagged with mines [ (2, 4), (3, 4)]. 

Let's flag one of the cell i.e. (3, 4).

ACTION: flag 3 4
