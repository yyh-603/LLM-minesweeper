REASON: Let's analyze the current state of the board step by step.

1. The cell at (3, 3) has 2 neighboring mines.
2. The only potential cells next to (3, 3) that could hold mines are (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 3), and (4, 4).
3. Given that cell (3, 3) counts 2 neighboring mines, and two cells (3, 4) and (2, 4) are next to it as well as flagged cell (3, 4).

We can infer that for safety and process of elimination we should mark these potential cells before opening any additional unknown cells nearby.

ACTION: flag 3 4
