REASON: The cell at (1, 3) has 2 neighboring mines, and we know that the cells at (1, 4) and (3, 4) are already opened and have 2 neighboring mines. From this information, we can infer that the cells at (2, 3) and (3, 3) are adjacent to these mines.

Furthermore, the cells at (3, 0) has 1 neighboring mine, and as we can see, no other cells around it are flagged, we can safely open it to get more information, while since (3, 1) have no infomation regardign its surrounding cell, we can safely flag it.

ACTION: flag 3 1
