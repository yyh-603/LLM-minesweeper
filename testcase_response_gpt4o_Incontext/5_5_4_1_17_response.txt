REASON: 
The cell at (1, 3) has 1 neighboring mine and all of its neighboring covered cells are at (0, 4), (1, 4), and (2, 4). There are more uncertain cells than the mine count for this current position.
The cell at (2, 3) has 3 neighboring mines, which means all its surrounding covered cells (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), and (3, 4) are dangerous. Especially in (1, 4), the common cells checked in the previous rows are suspected to contain the mines.
Thus evaluating among cells with the least suspects, we can only safely open the corner leaves within edges assuming closer data relevance. The cell (0, 2) in the top left corner shares most influence without danger spread.

ACTION: open 0 2
