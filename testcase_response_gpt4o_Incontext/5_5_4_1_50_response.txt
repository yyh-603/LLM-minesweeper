Let's analyze the given Minesweeper board carefully:

```
TABLE:
0 0 1 . . 
0 0 2 . . 
0 0 3 . . 
0 0 2 . . 
0 0 1 . . 
```

We can see several opened cells with numbers indicating how many neighboring mines they have.

### Analysis:

1. **Row 0:**

   - Cell (0, 2) has a number 1, suggesting there is 1 mine in its neighboring cells.
   - The only covered neighboring cell is (0, 3).

2. **Row 1:**

   - Cell (1, 2) has a number 2, meaning there are 2 mines in its neighboring cells.
   - The two covered neighboring cells are (1, 3) and (0, 3). 
   - Given (0, 2) already indicates there is 1 mine in its neighbors, it is clear that either (0, 3) or (1, 3) must be a mine to fit both constraints.

3. **Row 2:**

   - Cell (2, 2) has a number 3, indicating there are 3 mines in its neighboring cells.
   - The covered neighboring cells are (2, 3) and (1, 3). Since (1, 2) suggests 2 mines already, having (1, 3) as a mine means there must be an additional mine in (2, 3).

4. **Row 3:**

   - Cell (3, 2) has a number 2, suggesting there are 2 mines in its neighboring cells. 
   - The covered neighboring cells are (3, 3) and (2, 3), both of which are likely mines due to the cells above.

5. **Row 4:**

   - Cell (4, 2) has a number 1, showing there is 1 mine in the neighboring cells.
   - The only covered neighboring cell is (4, 3).

### Conclusion:

From the above, we know:
- Cell (0, 3) should be a mine based on the position (0, 2) and (1, 2),
- Cell (1, 3) also needs to be a mine.
- Cell (2, 3) and (3, 3) need to be mines based on the sum constraints.

Hence, the next safe action would be:
Reason: Since it is apparent that Cell (4, 3) is the only neighboring cell influenced by the number 1 on (4, 2), we can infer that it is safe to open Cell (4, 3).

ACTION: open 4 3
