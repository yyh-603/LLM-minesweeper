Let's analyze the given table step by step:

1. **Identify the cells with numbers**:
    - We can see the cells (1, 0) and (1, 1) have '1' indicating each has 1 mine in their proximity.
    - The cells (1, 2) and (3, 1) have '2' indicating each has 2 mines nearby.
    - The cells (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 2) have numbers '0', '0', '1', and '1' accordingly.

2. **Determine the likely positions for mines**:
    - Since cells (1, 0) and (1, 1) each have a '1', and their only unmarked neighbor is (0, 0), we can conclude (0, 0) likely has a mine.

3. **Safe cells to open**:
    - Cells that can be considered safe are those that are not adjacent or in proximity to identified mines (i.e., potential mine in (0, 0)).

4. **Cell (2, 0)**:
    - Since it holds a '0' indicating no neighboring mines, opening it should be safe and will potentially reveal adjacent cells.

REASON: Because the cell at (2, 0) has '0', indicating there are no neighboring mines, it is safe to open, and this action will also reveal its neighboring cells without detonating any mines.
ACTION: open 2 0
