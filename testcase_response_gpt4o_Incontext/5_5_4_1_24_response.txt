Let's analyze the given Minesweeper board step by step to determine our next action.

The current board state is:

```
0 0 1 . . 
0 0 1 . . 
2 2 2 . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
```

Looking at the opened cells, we can observe the following:

1. The cell at (0, 2) has a `1`, indicating there is exactly 1 mine in its neighboring cells.
2. The cells at (2, 0) and (2, 1) both have a `2`, indicating there are 2 mines in their neighboring cells.

First, let's utilize the information we have:

- The `1` at (0, 2) refers to one of its neighboring cells: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3).
- Considering the `2`s at (2, 0) and (2, 1), the possible neighboring cells are those in the 3rd row: (3, 0), (3, 1), and the cells not explored yet in the 2nd row: (2, 3).

Given that the cells in the first two rows (0, 1) and (1, 1) are already opened and have no mines, the remaining probable suspects are left.

Let's now analyze where mines could potentially be. Specifically, the cells that are not yet opened:

- (0, 3) and (0, 4)
- (1, 3) and (1, 4)
- (2, 3) and (2, 4)
- (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
- (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Based on the indication of the mines in these unopened cells, we realize multiple neighbors provide directions to suspect cells.

**Let's focus on the cells highlighted by the aids:**

- The cells next to the `2` values having maximum and overlapping hints could be critical.

Considering all the above evaluations:

REASON:
The cell at (2, 0) is showing as `2`, indicating 2 mines nearby. With row `1, 3`, `2, 3` seems the safest bet being underscored as empty or non-mine.
The probability deduces interactions around opened cells ascertain a safe action zone around flagged and higher number cells reflected.
With cross insights, we can safely open cell (2, 3).

Finally, the safe action inferred:

ACTION: open 2 3
