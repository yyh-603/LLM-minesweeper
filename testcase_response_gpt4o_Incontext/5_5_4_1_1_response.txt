Let's analyze the current Minesweeper board step by step.

```
TABLE:
. . . 1 0 
. . . 2 0 
. . . 2 0 
. 2 1 1 0 
. 1 0 0 0 
```

We focus on the numbers provided and their surroundings:

1. The cell (3, 1) has a number 2. This means there are 2 mines in the adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (3, 1) are:
   - (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)
   - (3, 0), (3, 2)
   - (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)

2. Currently, most of these adjacent cells are covered. To see if we can identify possible mines, let's analyze further.

3. The cell (3, 2) has a number 1. Adjacent cells to analyze for (3, 2):
   - (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
   - (3, 1), (3, 3)
   - (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

Since (2, 1) and (3, 1) contain the number 2 (and we assume (3, 2)) indicating 2 mines, we suspect the mine might be at (2, 3) and/or (3, 1).

As we confirm only one clear adjacent cell to open safely by considering the count 1 provided by (3, 2), we find the safe option:

**REASON:** The cell at (3, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and we can mark the safe cell to open; (4, 0) is open without a mine hazardous solution.

ACTION: open 4 0
