REASON: 
- The cell at (3, 0) has a number 2, indicating two neighboring mines. 
- The cell at (3, 1) has a number 2, indicating it also has two neighboring mines.
- Since neither (3, 2) nor (2, 2) can be mined (because their respective neighboring cells only have 1 mine), the two mines must be among the cells (2, 1), (4, 0), or (4, 1).

Based on the remaining clues:
- The only neighboring cells relative to cell (2, 0) for a high probability are cells (3, 0) and (3, 1).
- Given cells (2, 1), (4, 0), and (4, 1) provide crucial exclusion given the number applies then to row (3,0) and row (2, 1) preventing coverage at row (2, 2) or (3, 1, 2, 3,2) etc.

Thus, the cell at (2, 1) can safely be flagged.
