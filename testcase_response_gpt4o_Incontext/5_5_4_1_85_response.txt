Alright, let's analyze the given table step-by-step.

TABLE:
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
1 1 1 1 . 
0 0 0 1 . 

We have:
- An opened cell with the number 1 at row 3, column 0 to row 3, column 3
- An opened cell with the number 0 at row 4, column 0 to row 4, column 2
- An opened cell with the number 1 at row 4, column 3

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Cell (3, 0):** This cell has 1 neighboring mine. We don't have enough information yet to conclude where that mine is.
2. **Cell (3, 1):** This cell also indicates 1 neighboring mine.
3. **Cell (3, 2):** Same here, 1 neighboring mine.
4. **Cell (3, 3):** This cell also indicates 1 neighboring mine.
5. **Cell (4, 3):** This cell is also 1, consistent with the information from cell (3, 3).

Empty cells on row 4 indicate that there are no mines around them, confirming our observations so far.

From cells (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2) being empty and based on counting of their neighboring mines, we can safely deduce that the corners (5, column) and (4, 4) can't have mines directly next to them in the current row and column intersections.

#### Safe Cells:
Based on cells (4, below) being 0, and row 4 showing consistent numbering, opening (4, 2) is safe.

REASON: Cell (4, 2) is safe as empty cells around guarantee close to zero mines in its neighboring cells, ensuring it's mine-free probability is highest in improving remote checks consistently.

ACTION: open 4 4

Let's go!
