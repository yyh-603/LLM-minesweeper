REASON: Taking a look at the table, we can see that the cell at (2, 3) has a number 3, indicating that it has 3 neighboring mines. Currently, it has three covered neighboring cells at (1, 3), (3, 3), and (2, 4). 

Given that the cell at (2, 3) already indicates 3 neighboring mines and all three of its surrounding cells are covered, they must all be mines. We can safely flag these cells.

Let's start by flagging the cell at (1, 3).

ACTION: flag 1 3
