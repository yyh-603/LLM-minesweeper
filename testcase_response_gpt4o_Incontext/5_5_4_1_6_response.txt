Let's analyze the board and take note of the revealed numbers and their neighboring cells.

Current table:
```
. . 1 0 0 
. . 1 1 1 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
```

The clues we have:
- Cell (0, 2) has `1` neighboring mine.
- Cell (1, 2) has `1` neighboring mine.
- Cell (1, 3) has `1` neighboring mine.
- Cell (1, 4) has `1` neighboring mine.

Next, we will cross-check the neighboring covered cells of these revealed numbers.

For cell (0, 2):
- Neighboring cells: (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3)

For cell (1, 2):
- Neighboring cells: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)

For cell (1, 3):
- Neighboring cells: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)

For cell (1, 4):
- Neighboring cells: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)

We note that:
- Cells (1, 1) and (0, 1) are common neighbors for (0, 2) and (1, 2).
- Cells (2, 1), (2, 2) are common neighbors for (1, 2) and (1, 3).
- Cell (2, 4) is a common neighbor for (1, 3) and (1, 4).

Since the neighboring counts of `1` suggest that one of these cells in their vicinity is a mine, and we see multiple `1`s suggesting similar neighbors, from cell (1, 4), which has fewer remaining cells, we can deduce the following:

For the `1` in cell (1, 4) specifically, its neighbors (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3) and (2, 4). However, since cell (0, 3) and (0, 4) are `0`s, they confirm no mine within those. 
We can safely say that the probable mine should be nestled between cells for another `1`.

Hence, as a safer action based on uncoverings:

REASON: The cell (1, 4) has `1` neighboring mine, and the cells at (0, 3), (0, 4) being `0`, we know they ascertain no mines in their adjacent cells. So, new cells like (2, 3) and (2, 4) are openable without risk for current analysis.

ACTION: open 2 3
