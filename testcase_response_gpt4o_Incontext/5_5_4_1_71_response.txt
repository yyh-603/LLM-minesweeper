REASON: The cell at (2, 3) has 0 neighboring mines, and since it is already open, we know that all its surrounding cells must also be safe to open, provided they are within the board and still covered. Now, let's identify those neighboring cells:

- (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)
- (2, 2), (2, 4)
- (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Out of these cells, some of them might already be open or flagged according to the table provided. The cell (0, 4) in our table looks like it could be a valid candidate to open safely due to its proximity to multiple empty cells.

ACTION: open 0 4
