Alright, let's analyze the current board and decide on the next move.

Here is the current state of the table:
```
0 1 . . . 
0 1 . . . 
0 1 1 3 . 
0 0 0 2 . 
0 0 0 1 . 
```

We need to use the information from the opened cells to safely determine our next move.

1. Look at the cell (2, 3) which has a value of 3. This means it has 3 neighboring mines.
2. The neighboring cells of (2, 3) that are still covered are: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 4).

Since (2, 2) already has a '1' and its only remaining adjacent cell is (1, 2), (1, 2) should be a mine.

3. Since (1, 2) is a mine and (2, 3) needs 3 mines:
   - The remaining mines could be among (1, 3), (3, 3), (2, 4).

Let's think about safer, more certain moves first based on the current known numbers:

- Review cell (3, 3):
    - It shows '2', meaning two mines around it. If (3, 4) could be the second mine (since (2, 3)'s maximum seems fulfilled with potential flags).
    
- Check (4, 3) with '1', meaning a certain mine at (3, 4).
- Remaining intersection unchecked pattern like (2, 4) likely fed by overlaps around 3-4 filled paths.

Due to these careful intersections assessing the lowest risk,

**Next step:**
Looking closely, given surrounding clues share bounds expanding minimum values analytically flagged:

**We act on (1, 2) validation after flagging preliminary inclinations** balanced:

REASON: The cell at (2, 3) indicated three mines, and based around it's neighbors; multiple flagged intersections lead us to assert (1, 2) valid confirmation as 'flagged'.

ACTION: `flag 1 2`
