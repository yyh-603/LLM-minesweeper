REASON: We see that the cell at (3, 1) has a number 1, indicating exactly one neighboring mine. There's only one covered neighbor, which is the cell at (2, 1). Thus, we can safely flag the cell (2, 1) as a mine. Additionally, since the cell (4, 1) also has a number 1 and is surrounded by an already flagged cell (3, 1) and a covered cell (3, 2), we can safely open the cell at (3, 2).

ACTION: flag 2 1
