Before making a move, we need to analyze the current Minesweeper board configuration to determine the safest action to take.

1. We have the following board:
```
. . . . .
. . . . .
1 1 1 1 .
0 0 0 1 .
0 0 0 1 .
```

2. Let's focus on the known information and look for cells that already provide clues:
   - At (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2) and (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2) all contain the number '1', indicating there is exactly one mine adjacent to each of these cells.
   - The cells (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4) already contain '1', indicating there is exactly one mine adjacent to each of these cells.

3. The cells (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2) imply that their adjacent cells (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2) could potentially contain mines, but there is no further clue indicating which exact cells these might be. 
4. The cells (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2) indicate there is 1 mine adjacent to them. Given the board's symmetry, assessing the common unexplored points (covered cells) should help us determine actions.

However, since (3, 0) and (4, 0) have both 0 indicated adjacent mines, the cells adjacent to them exploring unexplored areas near to those with 1 under minimal threats seems to be a safe bet.

Given the unexplored cells near these indicators, I'll minimize the risk and opt for flagging any potentially safe opening like extending near areas conforming 0s:
```
Notice from the layout indicated covering points and presented cells.
We ensure to flag correctly least likely their neighboring mine indicators
```
Therefore:

REASON: We can infer that exploring cell (3,4) is plausible indicating safe openable slots extending from least risky covered adjacent ones.
ACTION: open 3 4
