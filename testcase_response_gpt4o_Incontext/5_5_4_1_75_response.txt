REASON: Let's analyze the current table:

- The cell at (0, 1) has 1 neighboring mine.
- The cell at (1, 1) has 1 neighboring mine.
- The cell at (2, 1) has 1 neighboring mine.
- The cell at (2, 2) has 2 neighboring mines.
- The cell at (2, 3) has 1 neighboring mine.
- The cell at (2, 4) has 1 neighboring mine.
- The rest of the cells in first two rows are either 0 or covered.

From this, we can deduce:
1. Since the cell at (0, 0) is adjacent only to (0, 1) and (1, 1), and both (0, 1) and (1, 1) have only a single mine nearby, only (0, 0) can be safe as it doesn't fit another mine.
2. The cells (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4) are unexplored and further information is needed to deduce their safety.

So, let's start by revealing some more information safely:
