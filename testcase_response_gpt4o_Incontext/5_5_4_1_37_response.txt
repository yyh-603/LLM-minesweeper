REASON: The cell at (1, 0) has 2 neighboring mines, and both (0, 0) and (2, 0) are covered. Similarly, the cell at (1, 1) also shows 2 neighboring mines, indicating there are certain mines in its vicinity. However, the cell at (4, 2) is covered, and if it did have a mine, cell (3, 2) would have shown a different number. Since the adjacent covered cells do not provide enough unique constraints to pinpoint certain mines, and assuming several cells need to be examined, a safe "open" action is preferred. The safest current guess, with minimal unrevealed mine probability based on nearby clues, is (4, 2).

ACTION: open 4 2
