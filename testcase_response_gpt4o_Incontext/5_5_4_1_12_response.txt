Let's analyze the given table step-by-step to determine the safest move.

TABLE:
. . . . .
. . . 2 1
. . . 1 0
. . 2 1 0
. . 1 0 0

First, we look at the revealed cells and check their neighboring cells.
- The cell at (1, 3) has a **2**:
  - It has two neighboring covered cells: (0, 2), (0, 3) and (0, 4).
  - Since only two neighboring cells are covered, and the number 2 indicates two mines, we can deduce that (2, 3) and (2, 4) cells are mines, but the rest of the cells are safe.

- The cell at (1, 4) has a **1**:
  - It has one neighboring covered cell: (0, 3).
  - Since only one neighboring cell is covered, and the number 1 indicates one mine, we can deduce that (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4) are mines.

- The cell at (1, 3) has a **1**:
  - It has one neighboring covered cell: (0, 2)
  - Since only one neighboring cell is covered, and the number 1 indicates one mine, we can deduce that (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), and (2, 4) are mines.


REASON: Because the cells at (1, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 3) indicate one neighboring mine each and only one neighboring covered cell remaining, we can safely deduce these cells are safe other cells as mines. 

ACTION: flag 0 3
