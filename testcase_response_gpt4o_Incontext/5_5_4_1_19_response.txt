Let's analyze the current state of the board row by row, column by column.

TABLE:
```
. . . . . 
. . . 2 1 
. . . 1 0 
. . 2 1 0 
. . 1 0 0 
```

Here's what we know:
- The cell at (1, 3) shows a 2, meaning it has 2 neighboring mines.
- The cell at (1, 4) shows a 1, meaning it has 1 neighboring mine.
- The cell at (2, 3) shows a 1, meaning it has 1 neighboring mine.
- The cell at (3, 2) shows a 2, meaning it has 2 neighboring mines.
- The cell at (3, 3) shows a 1, meaning it has 1 neighboring mine.
- The cell at (4, 2) shows a 1, meaning it has 1 neighboring mine.

Based on the cells with numbers, let's start by analyzing potential mine locations.

1. The cell at (1, 3) has 2 neighboring mines:
    - These neighbors are (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4).
    - The cells (1, 3) and (2, 3) can be checked as they also have neighboring numbers.

2. The cell at (1, 4) has 1 neighboring mine:
    - These neighbors are (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), and (2, 4).
    - Since (1, 4) shows 1, and its neighbors are mostly covered, we can correlate with the (1, 3) number.

3. The cell at (2, 3) shows 1:
    - These neighbors are (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 2).

4. The cell at (3, 2) shows 2:
    - These neighbors are (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), and (4, 2).

5. The cell at (3, 3) shows 1:
    - These neighbors are (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), and (4, 3).

6. The cell at (4, 2) shows 1:
    - These neighbors are (3, 1), (3, 2), and (3, 3).

Given:
- The biggest giveaway is the surrounding of the numbers.
- Specially with the (1, 4) having only 1 neighbor mine next door and the rest one.

REASON:
The cells located at (1,4), (2,3) are having the correlating values of 1 and considering cornered flags between (1,3) and (3,3), 
The cornered cells such as (3,2), (3,3) and (4,2) comes reduced suspects.
Hence, opening corner tow (3,2) seems edge free.
