Let's analyze the current state of the board to decide our next move.

--- Current Table ---
```
- Covered cells: '.'
- Empty cells (0): '0'
- Number cells (indicating the number of neighboring mines): '1', '2'
```

```
. . 1 0 0 
2 2 1 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
2 2 1 0 0 
. . 1 0 0 
```

### Step-by-step inference:

1. We see that cell (0, 2) has a '1' which indicates it has 1 neighboring mine.
2. Both (0, 1) and (1, 2) are neighboring cells to (0, 2), and they can be potential candidates for mines. 
3. Looking at the (1, 0) and (1, 1) cells, which have '2', they indicate 2 neighboring mines. The only possible covered cells adjacent to both (1, 0) and (1, 1) are (0, 0) and (0, 1). These must be our mines because there are no other possible placements.
4. After flagging (0, 0) and (0, 1), we observe that there are no immediate uncovered cells with clear mines near their neighboring cells, thus making cells around (2, 0) and their continuation potentially safer to open.

### Conclusion:

Based on these observations, flagging the cells (0, 0) and (0, 1) seems to be our logical move since they must contain the mines.

REASON: Based on the given numbers and their positions, cells (0, 0) and (0, 1) cover the only mines for the cells (0, 2), (1, 0), and (1, 1).

### Action:

We will flag the cells (0, 0) and (0, 1).

**ACTION 1:** flag 0 0 
**ACTION 2:** flag 0 1
