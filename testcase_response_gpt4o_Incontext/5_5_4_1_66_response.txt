REASON: The cell at (1, 2) has 2 neighboring mines. Based on the information we have:
- The cells at (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), and (2, 3) are still covered.

Since the cell at (1, 2) has 2 neighboring mines and the open cells around it already show some clues:
- The cells at (1, 1) and (0, 2) have no additional neighboring mines, and 
- The cell at (1, 2) already has one opened neighbor that is zero (no mines),

We can infer the safest cells to open further. Given these hints, we know it's safe to open cell (0, 3).

ACTION: open 0 3
