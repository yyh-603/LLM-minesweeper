Alright, let's analyze the table and determine the safest move we can. Here's the current table state again for reference:
```
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
1 2 . . . 
0 1 . . . 
0 1 . . . 
```
We have the following revealed information:
- The cell at (2, 0) shows the number 1, indicating that there is 1 mine adjacent to it.
- The cell at (2, 1) shows the number 2, indicating that there are 2 mines adjacent to it.
- The cell at (3, 0) shows 0 which suggests all surrounding cells are safe to open.
- The cell at (3, 1) shows 1.
- The cell at (4, 0) shows 0 which suggests all surrounding cells are safe to open.
- The cell at (4, 1) shows 1.

First, let¡¦s explore the safest open cells which are surrounded by 0 cells:
- (3, 0) shows 0, which means all surrounding cells are safe to open:
  Cells to consider opening (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), and (4, 1) since other sections and corresponding cell revealed are already opened.

REASON: Since the cell at (3, 0) and (4, 0) shows 0, it means all the surrounding cells are safe to open. We can safely open cell (3, 1), (4, 1)

**Considering above points and safest move:**
We can start with: 
ACTION: open 2 2
