Let's analyze the given Minesweeper board step by step to determine the most logical action.

Given table:
```
. . 1 0 0 
. . 2 1 1 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
```

### Reasoning:
1. Look at cell (0, 2) which has the number 1. This indicates that there is exactly one mine in its neighboring cells.
2. The neighboring cells of (0, 2) are (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3). Given the state of the board, the only covered neighboring cells are (0, 1) and (1, 1).
3. Next, consider cell (1, 2) which has the number 2, indicating that out of its 8 neighboring cells, there are 2 mines.
4. The neighboring cells of (1, 2) are (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3). Out of these, the covered cells are (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3).
5. Similarly, cell (1, 3) has the number 1. Its neighboring cells are (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4). The covered neighboring cells are (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4).

Reviewing the shared neighboring cells:
- Cell (0, 2) suggests a mine in (0, 1) or (1, 1).
- Cell (1, 2) suggests there are mines possibly around (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), or (2, 2), but since it has to account for two mines, it's mostly connected to (1, 3).
- Cell (1, 3) points only to one mine implying that checking other boxes ensures the calculated approaches.

### Conclusion:
Given the clues essentially focus on narrowing it down. 

Both the cells surrounding (1, 2) figure it can only hold a single (unopened) indication.

Thus, the next safest cell to open based on a shared minimum risk analysis:
```
open 0 3
```

### Execution:
REASON: By analyzing the numbers, we find that opening around shared indicators is safe. Let's implement opening it.
ACTION: open 0 3
