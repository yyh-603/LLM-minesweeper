REASON: We start by checking the cells with revealed numbers to infer the locations of mines. The cell at (3, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, with two of its neighbors covered. Likewise, the cell at (4, 2) also has 1 neighboring mine. Therefore, one of the neighboring covered cells in either (3, 3) or (4, 1) must be a mine. However, right now, there isn't enough information to definitively flag any mines or safely open any covered cells in their immediate vicinity. Since no certain actions are possible based on current information, we should attempt to open a cell not adjacent to the revealed numbers for potentially gaining more insight.
