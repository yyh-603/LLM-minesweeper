**REASON:** The cell at (3, 3) has 1 neighboring mine, and currently there are no flagged neighboring cells. However, we have a known number pattern around (2, 3):
- (2, 3) has a number 2, and we see 2 covered cells around it.
- Since (2, 3) must be touching exactly 2 mines and it only has two covered neighbors which are (1, 2) and (1, 4), we can be sure both these cells should contain mines.

Thus, we should flag those cells at (1, 2) and (2, 1) as mines.

**ACTION:** 
1. flag 2 4
2. flag 2 2
