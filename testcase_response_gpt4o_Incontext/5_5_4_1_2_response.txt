REASON: Because the cell at (2, 3) has 2 neighboring mines and we know that the cell at (2, 2) has 2 neighboring mines as well, indicating that both remaining cells (3, 2) and (3, 1) must be the mines. Thus, the cell at (2, 1) can be opened safely because the mine count for the two mines around cell (2, 2) is already achieved.

ACTION: open 2 1
