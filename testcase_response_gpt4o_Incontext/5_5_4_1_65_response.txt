REASON:  The cell at (2, 1) has 2 neighboring mines, and there are exactly two neighboring cells that are not opened: (1, 1) and (3, 1). Therefore, both of these cells are mines.
Since we have determined that the cells (1, 1) and (3, 1) are mines, we can safely open the cell at (1, 0) because there are no other potential mines next to it.
ACTION: open 1 0
