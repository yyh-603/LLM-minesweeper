Let's analyze the current board state step by step:

TABLE:
```
. . . . . 
1 1 1 2 . 
0 0 0 1 . 
1 1 1 1 . 
. . . . . 
```

- Scanning the board, we focus on the clues where the numbers and covered cells are close together.
- At cell (1, 3) with a "2":
  - The cells that are covered around (1, 3) are (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4). But (2, 3) and (2, 4) have one and zero number respectively, meaning these cells are not mine.
  - Thus, the cells that are covered are (0, 3), (0, 4), and (1, 4). The cell marked (1, 3) has 2 mines among these cells.
  - If (1, 4) were a mine, then (2, 3) would already indicate 1.
  - Logically, the two mines need to be present either at (0, 3) and (0, 4). 

Assessing evidence, cells close (3, 3) indicate 1 cell. We can determine actions based upon cells indicating:

- To prevent guessing to flagging mines, other clues must show differences.
- With available cells nearby cells indicating lowered generation inference the targeted "1" cells between finds indicate:

We go ahead to flagging the probable inferred cells for exploration and safer logical clarity:

REASON:
Because the cell at (1,3) infers numerical clue to minimal mine placements. The complex indicates determined clearer placement calculation inducing flag points based upon cells numerical structure.

ACTION:
`flag 0 3`

To avoid redundant, secondary cell; ensuing inference flag unnecessary actions placed least:

REASON:
Cells showed (1, 3) needed to evaluate aimed structure leading minimal marked cell clustering without accidental mistakes avoiding analyzed:

ACTION: 
`flag 0 4`

These cells ensure lowest inferred surrounding sequencing analysis consistent primarily numerical valid reasoning ensuring actions cells flagged will cause lesser impact risk thus stepped consistent revealing following 1 confirming mine placements thus future steps integrated approach:
open 3 1 without overlapping logical consistent secondary impact.
