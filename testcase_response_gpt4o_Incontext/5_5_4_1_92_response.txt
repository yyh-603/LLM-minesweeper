REASON: Let's analyze the table to find the safest possible move. The cell at (3, 3) reveals that there is 1 neighboring mine. There are still covered cells around it, which might be a mine, but the cell (4, 3) is blank (0). It's deducted that it's safe to open neighboring non-flagged cells next to (4, 3), which includes (4, 4).

ACTION: open 4 4
