REASON: 
The cell at (0, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and all the neighboring cells are covered. The cells at (1, 0), (1, 1), and (1, 2) have 1 neighboring mine each, but we cannot infer the exact position of the mine based on the current information. 

We should look at other parts of the board. Given it's the beginning stage with very few opened cells providing significant clues, it will be safer to open a cell with minimal surrounding constraints to potentially reveal more information.

Given the nature of the grid and the fact that cells (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), and (1, 4) are adjacent to an already opened cell, it's highly likely that one of these cells does not contain a mine. For our next action, let¡¦s open a central non-corner cell far from the initially opened cells to discover more information safely.

ACTION: open 2 2
