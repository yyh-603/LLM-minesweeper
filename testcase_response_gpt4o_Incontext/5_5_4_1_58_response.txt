Let's analyze the given Minesweeper board step by step to determine the safest cell to make our next move.

Current Board:
```
. . 1 0 0 
. . 1 1 1 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
```

Starting from the uncovered cells, let's consider the cell (0, 2) which shows the number 1. This number indicates that there is exactly one mine in the neighboring cells of (0, 2).

The neighboring cells of (0, 2) are:
```
(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1)
```

Of these neighboring cells, the cell (1, 2) also has a number showing 1, indicating it also has exactly one mine in its neighboring cells. 

The neighboring cells of (1, 2) are:
```
(0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3), (0, 3)
```

Since (1, 2) and (0, 2) both share common neighbors and both display the number 1, we can infer that the remaining 1 mine is among the common neighboring cells:
```
(0, 1), (1, 1)
```

So, cells (0, 1) and (1, 1) potentially contain mines. Let¡¦s leave them for now.

Next, let's look at the unopened cells around (0, 3), which shows the number 0. The number 0 indicates that none of its neighboring cells contain mines. The neighboring cells of (0, 3) are:
```
(0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4)
```

Given (0, 3) has no neighboring mines, we can safely open cell (0, 4), as it does not indicate any mines around.

REASON: Because the cell at (0, 3) has 0 neighboring mines, we can open the cell at (0, 4) safely.

ACTION: open 0 4
