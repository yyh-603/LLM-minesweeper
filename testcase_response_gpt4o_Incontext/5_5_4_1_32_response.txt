REASON: Let's analyze the current board state. We know that the cell at (3, 1) has a '3', indicating that it has 3 neighboring mines. Currently, there are only three covered cells around (3, 1): (2, 0), (3, 0), and (4, 0). Since no cells around (3, 1) are flagged yet, we can infer that all these three cells are mines. 

Therefore, we can safely flag the cell (2, 0) as it is definitely a mine.

ACTION: flag 2 0
