Let's analyze the given Minesweeper board to infer the safest action to take.

Current board state:
```
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
1 2 . . . 
0 1 . . . 
0 1 . . . 
```

Here's the detailed step-by-step reasoning:

1. The cell at (2, 1) has a number 2, indicating that it has 2 neighboring mines. The neighboring cells are (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), and (3, 2). 

2. Currently, we have enough information:
   - (2, 0) is opened and it is `1`. Therefore, there is 1 mine around it.
   - (2, 1) is `2`. Hence, there are total 2 mines around it.

3. The cell (1, 2) must not be one of the mines as the 2-mine requirement can be met by considering other covered cells (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), and (3, 2) surrounding (2, 1).

Therefore, the safest cell to open given the current information is (1, 2).

REASON: Because the cell at (2, 1) has 2 neighboring mines, and only 1 of the neighboring cells is opened with 1 mine indicated, we can safely open the cell at (1, 2). 

ACTION: open 1 2
