Let's analyze the given board step by step:

```
TABLE:
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
1 1 2 . . 
0 0 1 . . 
0 0 1 . . 
```

Based on the current state, we can observe the following:
- The cell at (2, 2) has the number 2, indicating it has 2 neighboring mines.
- The cell at (2, 1) has the number 1, indicating it has 1 neighboring mine.
- The cell at (2, 0) has the number 1, indicating it has 1 neighboring mine.

By checking the neighbors of the cells with numbers:
1. The cell at (2, 2) has two covered neighbors: (2, 3) and (3, 3).
2. The cell at (2, 1) has three covered neighbors: (2, 0), (2, 2), and (2, 3).

The only possible configuration that satisfies these conditions is:
- Both the (2, 3) and (3, 3) cells are mines.

Therefore, we can confidently flag the cell at (2, 3).

REASON: The cell at (2, 2) indicates that there are 2 mines among its neighbors, and based on the surrounding cells, it must be (2, 3) and (3, 3).

ACTION: flag 2 3
