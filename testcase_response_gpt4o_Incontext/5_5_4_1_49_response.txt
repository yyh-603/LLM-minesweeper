REASON: The cell at (1,1) has 2 neighboring mines, and the neighboring covered cells are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2). However, the cells at (1,0) and (2,0) have no neighboring mines as indicated by their numbers, meaning they have been safely opened without mines around them. Moreover, the cell at (2,1) indicates 0 neighboring mines, showing more safety around the cell. Considering these facts, the safest action is to open the cell (2,2) as it has sufficient coverage from other opened cells indicating safety.

ACTION: open 2 2
