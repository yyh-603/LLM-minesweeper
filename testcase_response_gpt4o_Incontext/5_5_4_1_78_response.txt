Given the current state of the table:

```
0 0 1 . . 
1 1 1 . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
```

Let's analyze the board to determine the next logical action:

1. The cell at (0, 2) has a "1", meaning it has 1 neighboring mine.
2. The neighboring cells of (0, 2) are: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3).
3. Among these, the cells (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 1) are already open and do not contain mines.
4. The cell at (1, 1) has a "1", implying it also has one neighboring mine.
5. The neighboring cells of (1, 1) are (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), and (2, 1). Since (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2) are already opened and do not contain mines, the mine must be in one of the other neighboring cells.

Given that the cell at (0, 2) has 1 mine and its neighboring unopened cell is (0, 3) (other cells surrounding (0, 2) are opened), it implies that the mine is at:

- For cell (0, 2): The mine is at (0, 3).

Therefore, the action should be to flag (0, 3). 

REASON: Given the information provided by neighboring cells with "1" mine indicates that cell (0, 3) must be a mine.
ACTION: flag 0 3
