REASON: 
- The cell at (1, 1) has 2 neighboring mines, and there are still two covered cells around it: (0, 0) and (1, 0).
- Similarly, the cell at (2, 1) also has 2 neighboring mines, reinforcing that (0, 0) and (1, 0) are likely mines.
- The cell at (3, 3) shows '1', and it's the only number surrounded by three covered cells: (3, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 2).
- The safest and most informative move is to open cell (3, 2) as it is not adjacent to any high-risk cells.

ACTION: open 3 2
