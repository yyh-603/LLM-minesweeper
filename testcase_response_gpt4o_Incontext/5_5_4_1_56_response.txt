REASON: The cell at (1, 3) has a '1', indicating there is exactly 1 mine among its neighboring cells. The cell at (2, 3) has a '2', which means there are exactly 2 mines among its neighboring cells. This suggests that both flagged cells might be next to these numbers. Reviewing adjacent cells, we see that the cell (2, 4) is the only cell covered near the '2' at (2, 3), so it has to be a mine.

ACTION: flag 2 4
