REASON: The cell at (2, 3) has a number "2", indicating it has 2 neighboring mines. The neighboring cells are:
  - (1, 3)
  - (1, 4): covered
  - (2, 4): covered
  - (3, 3): covered
  - (3, 4): covered

Currently, it has two adjacent covered cells: (2, 4), (3, 3), and (3, 4). Since we need to identify which are mines, let's start by flagging the obviously dangerous cells in the case we can find the neighboring cells already have matched with the number ("2"). 

However, there's no sufficient data to flag any of the neighboring cells immediately. Let's take a look at another known area where we can safely operate.

Cells (0, 3) and (1, 3) have been opened and the numbers match resulting directly with cells around them when considering (2, 3). Because (2, 3) indeed includes 2 neighboring mines, and we continue to analyze the condition mentioning the availability.

Let's proceed by appearing at the table logically to vicinity.
The best initial step here appears to be:

1. Let's open the cell adjacent to numbers align safe operations around them.

The safe operation:
ACTION: open 2 4
