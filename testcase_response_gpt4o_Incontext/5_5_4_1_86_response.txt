To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given table and its numbers to determine the safest action.

Let's observe the information we have:

- Cell (1, 1) has the number 2, which indicates there are 2 mines in its neighboring cells.
- Cell (1, 2) has the number 1, which indicates there is 1 mine in its neighboring cells.
- Cell (1, 3) has the number 1, which indicates there is 1 mine in its neighboring cells.
- Cell (2, 3) has the number 3, which indicates there are 3 mines in its neighboring cells.
- Cell (2, 4) has the number 2, which indicates there are 2 mines in its neighboring cells.

By analyzing these numbers, we get the following:

- Cell (2, 3) with the number 3 is critical. This means that all three mines are in its neighboring cells, among the covered cells (which are cells (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), and (3, 4)).
- For cell (2, 4) with the number 2, and knowing that cell (2, 3) already requires 3 mines in its neighboring cells, we can infer that there are overlapping mines in their common neighbors.

We should focus on ensuring that cells not adjacent to the 3 cells that need mines are opened harmlessly. Let's deduce step by step:

### For Cell (1, 3):

- The cell (1, 3) only needs one mine adjacent to it.
- Since cell (2, 3) already needs three mines in those adjacent squares, we can infer that (2, 3) causes these overlaps:
  => Mine at (2, 2)
  => Mine at (2, 4)

### So the safe action is: 
The cells that are adjacent and non-mine-identified based partially on cell (2, 3) must be focused.

### Adjacent non-demanding Cell

- Cell (3, 1): It belongs toward the least restrictive position that neither (2, 3) needs occupancy nor cells known to have been limited.

### Therefore: 

**REASON:**

1. The cell (2, 3) has 3 adjacent mines, immediately swayed the adjacent numerations.
2. The uncovered defaults adjacent range of cell demand safes exploratory, thus open cell (3,1)

**ACTION**: `open 3 1`
