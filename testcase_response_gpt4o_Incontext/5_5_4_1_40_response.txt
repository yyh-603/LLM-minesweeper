REASON: To determine the safest action, let's analyze the current state of the board.

Current board:
```
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
1 1 1 1 1 
0 0 0 0 0 
```

The `1`s in the fourth row indicate that each of these cells has exactly 1 neighboring mine. Since the cells above these `1`s are still covered, they are very likely to be mine-free to avoid multiple mines clustering around the `1`.

Let's choose cell (3,0), the first '1' in the fourth row as it has three surrounding covered cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), and (4,0). If the cell (2,0) is a mine, it will not affect the other `1`s in the fourth row due to position, making it a feasible choice to test by opening the surroundings gradually.

ACTION: open 3 0
