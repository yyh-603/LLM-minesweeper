Let's analyze the board step by step to determine the safest action.

Current table:
```
. . . . . 
1 2 . . . 
0 1 . . . 
0 2 . . . 
0 1 . . .
```

We can infer some information:
1. The cell (1,1) has a 2, meaning it has two mines adjacent to it.
2. The cell (1,0) has a 1, meaning it has one mine adjacent to it.
3. The cell (2,1) also has a 1, sharing information with (1,0).
4. The cell (3,1) has a 2, suggesting there are 2 mines adjacent to it.
5. The cell (4,1) has a 1, indicating a single mine nearby.

By cross-referencing:
- The cell (1,1) suggests neighboring cells have two mines. The neighboring cells are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).
- The cells marked '1' at (1,0) and (2,1) implies at least one of its adjacent cells is mine.
- Since (1,0) has to reveal one mine and it has only one covered cell nearby, it must be (1,2).

Hence, we can safely infer the following:

REASON: The cell at (1,1) has 2 neighboring mines, given cells at (1,0) and (2,1) show '1', and one possible mine indicates the cell at (1,2) might be a mine. We treat it cautiously until verified further.

Based on cells around (2,1), I conclude we can open (3, 3).

ACTION: open 3 3
