To solve the current Minesweeper puzzle, let's analyze the given board step by step:

Given table:
```
. . . . .
1 1 2 . .
0 0 1 . .
0 1 2 . .
0 1 . . .
```
We know the following:
- Number 1 indicates the cell has 1 neighboring mine.
- Number 2 indicates the cell has 2 neighboring mines.

Let's look at the numbers and try to deduce the positions of the mines:
1. Looking at the cell (1, 2) which has a "2", meaning it has 2 neighboring mines.
   - The neighboring cells of (1, 2) are (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3). 

Adjacent numbers lower than 2:
- Cell (1, 0) has '1' and its neighbors are Cells (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1).
- Cell (1, 1) has '1' and its neighbors are Cells (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), and (1, 2).

Both these numbers '1' suggest one mine is adjacent to (1, 0) and (1, 1) and only one remaining cell from (1, 0) would be the mine at (0, 1) because all other should be safe. 

Combining these suggestions:
- For cell (1, 0) with `1`, mine must be (0, 1) since all remaining ones cover else and no processed cells mines detected yet.

Hence, additional deductions:
- Cell (1, 2)'s 2 neighboring mines must be (0, 1) mine confirmed as well the likely the others at (0, 3)table thus remaining beyond of (2,4) non-mine counts i.e. possibles safe.

Given the above central pivots:
Here a central cells `cell1: (1, 2)` derives clearing the next pivotal exploratory verification relatively safest only:
ACTION:
ACTION points spot now:
next safe guessiest:

The cell suggesting potentially inferred verifying confirms beyond this scope:
cell: (3, 1)


Reasoning:
pop neighborhood thus cell proposes:
REASON: Because the cell at (1, 2) confirms `2 neighboring inferred mines` (logically ensure_neighbors();) determines near by extended ranges visibly opens rest central pivotal safes.

ACTION: open 3 1
