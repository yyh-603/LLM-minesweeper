Let's analyze the given table step-by-step:

TABLE:
```
. . . . .
1 1 1 1 .
0 0 0 1 .
1 2 1 1 .
. . . . .
```
Current open cells and their numbers:
1. The cells (1,0) to (1,3) have '1', which means there is exactly 1 mine in the surrounding 8 cells.
2. The row 2 cells (1,0) to (1,3) are '0' indicating no mines nearby.
3. One '1' is open in cell (2,3).
4. One '1' is open in cell (3,0).
5. The cell (3,1) has '2', which means there are 2 mines in the surrounding cells.
6. The cell (3,2) has '1', indicating 1 neighboring mine.

Step-by-step reason:
- Considering (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) are all '0', we can be fairly certain that adjacent cells to these zeros (like cells (2,0), (2,4), (3,0), (3,4), (1,4)) should be free of mines.
- Now, as we look at the hints surrounding flagged cells, such as the cell with 2 (location (3,1)), we know all cells corresponding to the number 2 should be flagged or checked.
- Checking further, considering the rule of cells, 2 is tightly linked to neighboring cells (like (3,1)) should get further confirmations. 

The safest step would be to open cell (4,4), advancing with a more secure opening scope.

**REASON:**
The cell at (2,2) is '0', meaning all neighboring cells are safe to open, including cell (4,4).
Therefore opening is the safest option.

**ACTION: OPEN 4 4**
