REASON: Let's analyze the opened cells to deduce the safe move.

- The cell (0, 1) has a '2', which means it has two mines in its neighboring cells.
- The cell directly adjacent is covered (0, 0) and (1, 1) is also covered.

Likewise:
- The cell (1, 1) which is opened, also shows a '2', which shares coverage of the cell (2, 1) and (0, 0).

But:
- The cell (2, 1) shows a '1', which shares mines towards (0, 1) and another cell (2, 1) showing (1);

Because there are no overlapping mines combinations in this case, we can safely deduce to flag covered cells next to (0, 1)

ACTION: flag 0 0
