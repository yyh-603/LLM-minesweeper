REASON: 
Let's analyze the given board step by step:
- The cell at (2, 1) has 3 neighboring mines.
- The cell at (2, 2) has 2 neighboring mines.
- We need to identify safe cells first.
- The cell at (3, 2) is uncovered and has 0 neighboring mines, meaning all neighboring cells are safe.

Given this, we can deduce that the cells around (3, 2) are safe to open: namely, (3, 3), (4, 2), and (4, 3), since they have a number indicating they have no neighboring mines.

ACTION: open 3 3
