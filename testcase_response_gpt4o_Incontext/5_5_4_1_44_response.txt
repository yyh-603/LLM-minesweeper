Let's analyze the current board and determine the next safe action.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Cell (1, 3):**
   - The value is `2`, indicating 2 neighboring mines.
   - Neighboring cells: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
   - Known open cells: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2)
   - Unknown cells: (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)

2. **Cell (2, 1):**
   - The value is `2`, indicating 2 neighboring mines.
   - Neighboring cells: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)
   - Known open cells: (1, 1), (1, 2)
   - Unknown cells: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)

3. **Cell (3, 1):**
   - The value is `3`, indicating 3 neighboring mines.
   - Neighboring cells: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
   - Known open cells: (2, 1)
   - Unknown cells: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)

4. **Conclusion:**
   - **Cell (2, 2)** is common among all above mentioned cells with unknown status.
   - **Cell (2, 4)** only appears in the context of Cell (1, 3).

### Reasoning:

Given the above analysis, **Cell (2, 2)** has the highest likelihood of being a mine because it has multiple indicators pointing towards it:

- From **Cell (2, 1)**, (2, 2) is 1 of 5 unknown neighbors.
- From **Cell (3, 1)**, (2, 2) is 1 of 7 unknown neighbors.
- From **Cell (1, 3)**, (2, 2) is 1 of 5 unknown neighbors.

But the concrete safer step is to open less influenced, and we know **Cell (1, 4)** only referenced by Cell (1, 3).

### Action:
ACTION: open 1 4
