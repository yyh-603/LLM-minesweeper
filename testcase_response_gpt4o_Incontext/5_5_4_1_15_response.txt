REASON: The cell at (2, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and it has 4 covered neighboring cells. Since none of the neighboring cells of (2, 2) provide enough additional information to infer a safe move or a mine directly, let's focus on the cells around the already opened cells that might offer a safer opening. 

The cells (2, 3) and (2, 4) both have known values and no neighboring mines indicated, suggesting that any immediate neighbors with uncovered cells are potentially safe. However, none of these guarantee safety or mine presence conclusively because the borders extend into inferred areas.

Given no immediate inference certainty for mines, we should choose a covered cell that minimizes risk and could potentially open up new information safely. The top-left corner is often a good candidate since it minimizes the number of immediate neighbors that are already flagged as problematic:
