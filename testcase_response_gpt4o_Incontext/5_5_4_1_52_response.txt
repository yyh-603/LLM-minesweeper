REASON: The cells in the first two rows and the first cell in the third row are already opened and have no mines. The cell at (1, 0) shows 2, indicating it has 2 mines nearby. The cells at (2, 0) and (2, 1) must be mines because they are the only covered cells left. This also means that the cells at (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4) cannot be mines, as the number of mines nearby the opened cells has been satisfied. Hence, the safest move would be to open the next cell in the third row.

ACTION: open 2 2
