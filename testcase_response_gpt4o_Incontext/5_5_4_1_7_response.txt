Let's analyze the current board:

TABLE:
```
. 1 0 0 0 
. 2 1 0 0 
. . 1 0 0 
. . 3 1 1 
. . . . . 
```

We see the following numerical clues:

1. The cell (0,1) has 1 neighboring mine.
2. The cell (1,1) has 2 neighboring mines.
3. The cell (1,2) has 1 neighboring mine.
4. The cell (2,2) has 1 neighboring mine.
5. The cell (3,2) has 3 neighboring mines.
6. The cell (3,3) has 1 neighboring mine.
7. The cell (3,4) has 1 neighboring mine.

Now let's infer some information:

- For cell (1,1) which has 2 mines nearby:
    - Its potential neighbors are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2). 
    - Given that (0,1) and (1,2) are neighboring the mines cell (2,2) which has 1 mine nearby, we can infer that the mines could be located at (0,0), (1,0), or (2,1).

- For cell (3,2) which has 3 mines nearby:
    - Its neighboring cells are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3). 
    - Given that (3,3) and (3,4) have only 1 mine nearby, the mines could be located at the intersection of these regions (2,1), (2,2) and (4,1).

Given all the surrounding numbers and their respective neighbors, it's logical and safe to start revealing the most probable safe cell which is:

Cell (2,3) since it only has 1 mine nearby and none of its neighboring cells are considered mines so far.

REASON: 
The cell at (2,2) has 1 neighboring mine, and knowing that the neighboring cells (1,2) and (3,2) are clear of mines based on analysis, then it is safe to open the cell at (2,3).
