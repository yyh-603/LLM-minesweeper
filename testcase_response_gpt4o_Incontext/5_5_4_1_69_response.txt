To analyze the given table and decide on a safe action, let's start by examining the current state:

```
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
. . . . . 
1 1 1 1 . 
0 0 0 1 .
```

### Analysis:

1. We already have a few numbers on the board. Let's note down their locations and immediate neighboring cells:
    - Cell (3, 0) has a '1':  
      - Neighboring cells -> (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1)

    - Cell (3, 1) has a '1':
      - Neighboring cells -> (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)

    - Cell (3, 2) has a '1':
      - Neighboring cells -> (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)

    - Cell (3, 3) has a '1':
      - Neighboring cells -> (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)
   
    - Cell (4, 3) has a '1':
      - Neighboring cells -> (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4)

2. We already have a cell at (4, 0) with '0'. This means the following cells are safe to open:
    - (3,0), (3,1), (4,1)
    - Because '0' signifies no neighboring mines.

3. Since any neighboring cell of (4,0) is safe and '0' means there can't be a mine around, let's start with the top neighboring cell.

### Decision:

We can safely "open" cell (4, 1).

### Final Action:

```
REASON: The cell at (4, 0) is '0', indicating no mines in the neighboring cells. Therefore, cell (4, 1) must be safe to open.
ACTION: open 4 1
