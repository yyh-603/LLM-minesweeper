To determine the safest cell to act on, we need to analyze the given information. Let's look at the grid and the opened cells:

```
0 0 0 1 .
0 0 0 1 .
0 0 1 2 .
0 0 2 . .
0 0 2 . .
```

For analysis:

- The cell at (0, 3) has 1 neighboring mine.
- The cell at (1, 3) also has 1 neighboring mine.
- The cell at (2, 3) has 2 neighboring mines.
- The cell at (3, 2) has 2 neighboring mines.
- The cell at (4, 2) has 2 neighboring mines.

Firstly, let's find unmarked, unopened cells adjacent to opened cells to determine safe moves:

1. Check cell (0, 3) with 1 neighboring mine:
    - Possible mine candidates: (0, 4), (1, 4)
    - Given (1, 3) and (0, 3) both being 1: One mine has to be in either (0, 4), (1, 4) combined.

2. Check cell (2, 3) with 2 neighboring mines:
    - Possible mine candidates: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 3)
    - Given (3, 2), (4, 2) with 2: Two should be combinedly these 2 hints matching remaining areas/possibilities.

3. Check cell (3, 2) with 2 neighboring mines:
    - Possible mine candidates: (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From neighborhood clues, choosing the safest move:

The cells candidates:
    - (3, 3), (3, 4) become key.

Let's find the exact safest potential non-mine:

After combinational analysis across clues:
The safest non-mine inferred cell:

REASON: Based on consistent given clues around surrounding cells, safest opens (3, 0~4) becomes logical pushing safest adjacency exploration option.

ACTION: open 0 4
