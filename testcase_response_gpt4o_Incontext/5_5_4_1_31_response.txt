REASON: 

1. Observing the table, the cell at (3, 3) has four neighboring cells which are yet to be revealed:
   - (2, 2)
   - (2, 3)
   - (2, 4)
   - (3, 2).
   
2. The cell at (3, 3) indicates 1 neighboring mine, and the same cell (3, 3) can only have one mined cell:
   - As there is only one neighboring mine in this configuration, we'll explore further to identify the safest move.
   
3. By extending our view to the visible hints:
   - The cell at (3, 2) has a `1` indicating there is one mine among its neighbors.
   - The cell at (3, 2) can correlate that its adjacent cell (3, 3) might be the one with the mine if considering the first row configuration.

4. Safe Move Approach:
   - Considering the cells in the corner section with logical steps and no visible neighbor's condition fulfillment.

5. Keeping edge safe analysis:
   - The only other unfulfilled condition with guaranteed safety in visibility to explore.
   - The uncovering of a `0` will reveal a larger section in edge approach carve ensuring minimal risk.
