REASON: The cell at (0, 2) has 1 neighboring mine, and the cells at (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 2) all show the number 1 as well. This implies that there is a mine in one of the neighboring covered cells to these identified cells. We can safely infer that the only possible location for the mine in the first column with 1 indication is at (1, 2). However, this does not provide enough certainty about the location of mines in surrounding cells. 

Since every number '1' in column 2 has covered cells only to its left (column 1), it implies all these covered cells possibly contain mines but we can't be certain through this information alone. Other cells that can provide indirect safe options would be cells showing '0'. Cells with '0' means surrounding cells are non-mines and thus can reveal more cells that hint at more placements.

Therefore, I will perform an open operation on a cell showing 0 along row 0, as it's confirmed safe. We'll start revealing safe borders gradually. 

ACTION: open 0 3
