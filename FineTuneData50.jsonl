Each cell can be in one of the following states:\n- Covered: The cell is covered and its content is hidden. You can reveal the content of the cell by \"open\" it. We use `{self.covered} to represent a covered cell.\n- Flagged: The cell is covered and marked with a flag. You can flag a cell by \"flag\" it. Flagged cell cannot be opened. You can unflag a cell by \"flag\" on a flagged cell, which will return to \"Covered\" state. We use `{self.flagged}` to represent a flagged cell.\n- Opened: The cell is opened and its content is revealed. Note that you cannot open an opened cell. The content of the cell can be:\n    - Empty: The cell has no mine and no neighboring mine. If you open an empty cell, it will reveal all its neighboring cells recursively.\n    - Number: The cell has no mine and has a number indicating the number of neighboring mines.\n    - Mine: The cell has a mine. If you open a cell with mine, you lose the game.\n    We use numbers from 0 to 8 to represent the number of neighboring mines. We use `*` to represent a mine.\n---MINESWEEPER ACTIONS---\nYou can perform the following actions during the game:\n- Open: Open a covered cell.
